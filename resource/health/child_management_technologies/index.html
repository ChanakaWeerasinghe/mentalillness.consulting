          <h3 id="child-management-technologies">Child Management Technologies</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Technology is models, <strong>methods and techniques</strong> that give the desired result. Different parents have their own vision, how it is possible and necessary to achieve what is needed from the child, the methods and techniques used depend on this vision in many respects. Unlike upbringing, which shapes the personality as a whole, management solves operational issues &ldquo;here and now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any technology is based on some vision of the nature of the child and the tasks of the parent. In the case of a negative worldview of this vision is embodied in the model &ldquo;Garden with weeds&rdquo;, in the case of a positive - &ldquo;Gardener and a rose.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="garden-with-weeds">Garden with weeds</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;Garden with weeds&rdquo; model is based on the belief that a child needs to be treated like a neglected garden, to find and weed out weed deficiencies in his soul. Parents struggle with laziness and disorganization of children, trample on children's aggressiveness and burn baby lies with a hot iron. The usual result: the contact is destroyed, the efficiency is low, little is achieved. Sukhomlinsky said that in this case, education is &ldquo;on the wrong track.&rdquo; “Vices,” he wrote, “are eradicated by themselves, go unnoticed by the child, and their destruction is not accompanied by any painful phenomena if they are replaced by a stormy growth of virtues.” The model is controversial, working more positively, see → .</p>
<p>Gardener and rose</p>
<p>In this model, the child is seen as a beautiful flower, which the caregiver and gardener should take care of. A good gardener must understand the nature of a flower, bush or fruit tree in order to grow in it what is laid in it by its nature ↑ . Here in the child, parents try to discern what the child’s inclinations are and support him in his aspirations and endeavors. With this approach, the educational results are better than in the &ldquo;Garden with Weeds&rdquo; model, but the metaphor of the seed from which the child’s personality unfolds is controversial .</p>
<h3 id="impact-target">Impact target</h3>
<p>Some of the parents think it is right to turn to feelings more often, some to the mind, someone to solve problems by training that works at the body level.</p>
<p>Training, or carrot and stick model</p>
<p>It seems to be the most natural: to reward for a good deed, for a bad deed - to punish, scold. In principle, this is reasonable, but there are also disadvantages: this system requires the constant presence of an educator, a “stick” destroys the contact between a child and an educator, and a “carrot” teaches a child not to do good without an award &hellip;</p>
<p>Options: Bribery. &ldquo;If you're good, I'll buy you ice cream.&rdquo; In skillful hands, he goes over to the Reward for Success model. More often ends with a pedagogical situation. Little tyrant: “If you do not buy me ice cream, I will behave badly!”</p>
<p>Another option: a short leash - a positive training, practicing unconditional obedience. A lot of interesting tasks, simple instructions and immediately - a positive reinforcement .</p>
<p>The carrot and stick model is controversial if it turns out to be not the main but the main one. The matter of education is better if the method of rewards and punishments is supplemented by the method of negative and positive reinforcements, and preference is given to positive reinforcements and reinforcements not so much of desirable external actions as of desirable internal states and relationships. In any case, it is useful to remember that real education goes far beyond the best training ↑ .</p>
<h3 id="appeal-to-the-senses">Appeal to the senses</h3>
<p>Appeal to feelings is more often a female strategy. The standard options are appeal to empathy (“See how your sister cries because of you!” Or “Please don’t anger your mom”), distraction from unwanted things (“Look what a bird!) And attraction to the desired, as well as decision making based on the feelings that the child demonstrates to parents (Traffic Light model).</p>
<p>Look, sister is crying from you!</p>
<p>To the great surprise of adults, and especially mothers, this treatment usually does not affect young children at all. However, if children are angry for a long time in such situations, sooner or later they will understand what adults want from them, and begin to portray remorse. However, children like to copy adults, and if mother is often upset, children begin to repeat after her. It is hard to call it genuine empathy, but the road to it is paving. Real empathy arises in children no earlier than seven years of age, and here everything is very individual. If the children are very disposed towards this, but there are no dispositions towards this.</p>
<p>Please don’t angry mom!</p>
<h3 id="when-the-child-does-not-obey">When the child does not obey,</h3>
<p>the mother begins to upset herself and show how bad she is from this behavior of the child. This model is very common, and is usually practiced among women. Her results? In young children, especially in girls, guilt , attachment and obedience are successfully formed . Older children, and especially boys, are worse off, they get irritated or do not care about their mother’s feelings.</p>
<p><strong>Look what a bird!</strong></p>
<p>The child is looking for more and more attractive things around him, distracting from the unnecessary. Doesn’t eat porridge - we’ll offer an apple. She doesn’t want to do morning exercises, we suggest we go swimming with friends. Swimming didn’t go - we’ll try to interest a beautiful game of tennis. Works well with young children. The older the children, the more often failures occur. As a rule, this path ends with the Bribery model.</p>
<p>In this model, parents in their actions are guided by the feelings and reactions of the child. Feelings and reactions of the child are the colors of the traffic light for the parent. When a child responds positively to the actions of parents, enjoys the actions of parents, this is a green light for them, a signal to parents: &ldquo;Go ahead! You are doing everything right.&rdquo; If the child fulfills the parents&rsquo; requests reluctantly, forgets, snarls - this is the yellow color for the parents, the warning color: &ldquo;Attention, be careful, something seems wrong! Think before you say or do it!&quot;. If the child is in protest, this is the red color for the parents, the signal is: “Stop !!! Freeze! In this direction, not a step forward! Remember where and what you violated, urgently and environmentally correct!”</p>
<h3 id="the-controversial-model">The controversial model.</h3>
<p>The advantages of this model are sensitivity to feedback, the disadvantages are that it is easy to fall under the influence of a child. The child begins to control the parents, showing them their reactions &hellip;</p>
<p>Appeal to the mind</p>
<h3 id="traffic-rules">Traffic rules.</h3>
<p>This model assumes that the child is behaving badly because he simply does not know or has forgotten the rules. And if you tell him the rules and he learns them, then he will do everything &hellip; And the parent explains everything, teaches, tells. Children can listen to this sadly, but - they have to &hellip; Of course, knowledge of how to behave is necessary, but knowledge alone without interest and training is dead. It’s easy to make sure that children know all the main rules of behavior: “Fighting is bad,” “Lying badly,” “Things must be put in place,” but in a clash of reason and feelings, feelings more often prevail in children, especially if the child does not understand the meaning of the rule: “ Why do you need to put things in some place, if they are already so good? &quot; Children need to be taught the rules, the rules should be simple and understandable,↑ &hellip; Total, if the model &ldquo;Rules of the movement&rdquo; is not auxiliary, but the main one, then this is a controversial model.</p>
<p>Methods and techniques for managing a child
Methods and techniques for managing a child are highly dependent on the child's controllability, the views and motivation of the parents, and the requirements of a particular situation. In free education, the method of well-directed freedom is more often used, in disciplinary - instructions and a reinforcement system.</p>
