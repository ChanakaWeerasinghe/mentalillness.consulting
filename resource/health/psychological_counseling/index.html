Each of them conveyed to us his vision, his experience, his wisdom in an interesting science - counseling . In this work, I want to summarize the knowledge and formulate my understanding of the stages of counseling. The material can be used as a cheat sheet and for introspection consultation.">

<h3 id="clarification-of-the-situation-and-the-request">Clarification of the situation and the request</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first task, of course, is to maintain the status of a competent specialist . At this stage, the client will tell a lot of different things, mixing everything together. The consultant must carefully choose which lines to respond to and which ones to skip. Which questions are answered in detail, and which are concise. Each phrase of the consultant should be thought out - how will the client react? Skip ears? Thinking about it? Will go into unnecessary emotions? Superfluous words, superfluous reactions lower the status of a consultant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second task of this stage is to rebuild the client from longing and negativity. What are some ways to do this?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Talk about feelings and about everything internal to translate into conversations about behavior. “How do you behave, what do you do when you are in such a mood?” There may be a conversation about internal behavior - internal decisions of a person or his way of thinking. “Why do you think so? Don’t think so anymore! Think like that! ”</li>
<li>Suggest something to eat (e.g. sweets for tea). The chewing process is not compatible with hysteria.</li>
<li>Talk about something clever, where you need to think, directly or indirectly related to the topic of the client (to calculate some numbers: money, time, amount of resources, etc., to build the logic of actions: first this, then that, etc. P.)</li>
<li>Relax the client by talking about pleasant things or NLP techniques.</li>
<li>Rebuild the client with their intonations - business, positive, friendly.</li>
<li>Talk about how you, as a consultant, deal with negative emotions, how to get out of them. During the consultation, share with the client what is happening with me. Demonstrate to the client how I deal with this condition. The client understands - since the consultant can talk about this, then I can. Here's how it turns out you can handle it - you can talk about it.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The third objective of this stage is to involve the client in the work . To do this, you can:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/post/health/couns.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Diligent client</strong> - you need to help transfer the request from the problem to the conscious, and then to the developing one.</p>
<p><strong>To a stupid client</strong> - the consultant selects the request himself, translating it into the client’s delirium so that the task is clear and close to the client. Moreover, the consultant has no task to dissuade, open his eyes to the truth, etc. On occasion, you can talk about some research or refer to the relevant articles, showing your competence.</p>
<p>The next stage of the consultation is</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="search-for-a-solution">Search for a solution</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol>
<li>Turn to your own experience and practice.</li>
<li>Consider personal relationships from a position of business interaction, and business relationships from a personal perspective.</li>
<li>Use the Synton card for personal diagnosis.</li>
<li>Do not rush to engage in subtle and deep psychology, when you can change the everyday alignment of forces. “Girl, surround yourself with guys, choose from many, and then this one will agree for everything for you!”</li>
<li>Forming your concept is a mechanism that explains what happens in a client’s life.</li>
<li>Offering a solution to a client, the consultant does not insist, but “sells”, at the end specifying: “Will this recommendation suit you?”</li>
</ol>
<p>The task of involving the client in the work at this stage is also very important. How can a consultant help a client get involved?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>Pretend to be dull, force the client to explain the details.</li>
<li>Play roles. If the client perceives the consultant as a Strict father or a Custodial mother, it may be difficult for him to think independently. Moving to the position of Business partner or Sincere friend, the consultant can significantly affect the activity of the client. Intervention - change your behavior and watch how the client’s behavior changes. When a client comes with his request, he is a master in this request, he has been doing this all his life. Our task is to see where he will drag us into his game.</li>
<li>To draw the attention of the client to his behavior here and now, during the consultation, to find analogies with his behavior in life. Everything that the client does in life, he does in consultation. The tool of the consultant is to show the client that his patterns of behavior and communication in life are manifested at the current moment, during the consultation in communication with the consultant.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../../../images/post/health/couns1.png" alt="image"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="customer-service">Customer service</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We distinguish two main tasks of this stage - creating a resource state for a client, and resolving client difficulties using techniques and methods that a consultant owns.</p>
<p><strong>What methods do we have for solving these two problems?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drawing up a clear action plan, ORA.</li>
<li>Desensitization and all NLP techniques.</li>
<li>Testing behavior, intonation, facial expressions.</li>
<li>Coaching techniques for setting goals, choosing paths, etc.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-final-stage">The final stage</h3>
<p>The final stage gives the consultation a logical and emotional completeness. It involves three tasks:</p>
<p>Creating customer intentions. The questions “What will you do?” Or “How will you now think / relate to the situation?” Help the client formulate his intention. Speaking their intentions out loud, the client increases the chances that the intentions will be realized. If after that you talk to the client about the nuances (how exactly he will do what he is going to do, when exactly he will do it, in which place, under what circumstances, etc.) and ask the client to send a progress report - then the chances of fulfilling the intention will increase .
At the next consultation, you must definitely ask the client about the fulfillment of his intention. Joint analysis of the results will help move forward more efficiently. Of course, that punishing the client for failure to fulfill obligations is inappropriate. But it is possible to arrange an additional conversation from this.
“Well, you did not send me an SMS, but what did you do to not send an SMS, and how does it happen in your life? How did you manage to not send me sms for 2 whole nights in a row? How many times a day did you recall this? Probably remembered in the evening? With each memory, did you have some kind of inner decision or resistance, or something else? You seemed to be going to &hellip; &quot;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="maintaining-respect-and-status">Maintaining respect and status.</h3>
<p>The first mistake of beginning consultants is when the main work is done, relax and leave the role of a consultant, crumple the end of the session. The second mistake is the desire to ask the client for feedback on their work. Instead, you need to ask the question: “What do you take for yourself from today's consultation?” Thus, the client does not evaluate the consultant, but his thoughts.
Involvement in self-development. A competent consultant at the end of the consultation will definitely make a broach for the next meeting - he will show the client what else he should work on in the future.
These marginal notes came to me thanks to the Consulting Laboratory. I would be glad if they would be useful to other students.</p>
