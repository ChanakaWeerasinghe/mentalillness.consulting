  <meta name="description" content=" kidneys are also called “reeds” in our language, one on each side. The kidneys perform a variety of functions, such as filtering waste products from the blood and releasing them into the urine, controlling the concentration of electrolytes in the blood, and controlling blood pressure. Blood that enters the kidneys through the renal arteries passes through thin capillary bundles called glomeruli and releases water, electrolytes, and waste products into Bowman&#39;s pockets. The urine flows through the tubules into the pyelone, and the urine collects through the urinary tract and is stored in the bladder and then discharged out of the body along the urethra.">
