<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anxiety reduction techniques are learned skills that can be used by an individual to help overcome anxiety and its associated mental and physical symp- toms, including tension, worry, and nervousness. These techniques include relaxation, visualization and imagery, diaphragmatic breathing, stress inocula- tion, and meditation.
Relaxation or progressive relaxation
This anxiety reduction technique is based on the premise that anxiety and stress are associated with muscle tension. When one achieves deep muscle relax- ation, muscle tension is reduced, and this relaxed state is incompatible with anxiety.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="visualization-and-imagery">Visualization and imagery</h3>
<p>This anxiety reduction technique aids the person in making a mental image of what he or she wants to accomplish. For example, an individual might wish to release worries or concerns, or create a relaxing image to escape momentarily from a stressful event.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="diaphragmatic-breathing">Diaphragmatic breathing</h3>
<p>This technique involves teaching a person to breathe sufficient amounts of air to help his or her blood fill with oxygen and be purified properly. In this technique, the individual breathes deeply from the diaphragm, which is located low in the chest, near the abdomen.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="stress-inoculation">Stress inoculation</h3>
<p>Self-talk, or the things that people tell themselves about stressful situations, can be habitual. For exam- ple, a person may take an ordinary event and auto- matically magnify its importance. Stress inoculation training is a type of therapy that teaches clients to cope with anxiety and stressful situations by learning more functional patterns of self-talk.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="meditation">Meditation</h3>
<p>In this anxiety reduction technique, an individual is trained to focus his or her attention on one thing at a time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>The goal of learning and implementing anxiety reduction techniques is to help reduce the intensity of
anxiety that an individual feels. These techniques are also helpful in teaching people how to relax and man- age stress. Many of the techniques are used in combi- nation with each other. For example, a person may be taught diaphragmatic breathing while also engaging in relaxation techniques, a visualization and imagery exercise, and/or meditation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="relaxation-or-progressive-relaxation">Relaxation or progressive relaxation</h3>
<p>Relaxation has been used to help women during childbirth and people with chronic pain. Relaxation has also been used to treat muscle tension, muscle spasms, neck and back pain, and to decrease perspi- ration and respiratory rates. Furthermore, relaxation can help with fatigue, depression, insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome, high blood pressure, mild phobias, and stuttering.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="visualization-and-imagery-1">Visualization and imagery</h3>
<p>Visualization and imagery techniques have been helpful in treating general or specific anxiety, head- aches, and muscle tension and spasms. They are also useful in reducing or eliminating pain, and in the recovery from illnesses and injuries. Visualization and imagery techniques have also been used by ath- letes to help them achieve peak performance.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="diaphragmatic-breathing-1">Diaphragmatic breathing</h3>
<p>Diaphragmatic breathing has been found to help people reduce anxiety, depression, irritability, muscle tension, circulation, and fatigue.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="stress-inoculation-1">Stress inoculation</h3>
<p>Stress inoculation has been helpful in reducing interpersonal and general anxiety. For example, these techniques may be used when a person has an upcoming job interview, speech, or test. Stress inocu- lation has also been used to treat phobias, fear of heights, and chronic anger problems.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="meditation-1">Meditation</h3>
<p>Meditation has been used to treat and prevent high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, migraine headaches, immunization diseases, obsessive thinking, attention problems, anxiety, depression, and anger difficulties.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>These various techniques are often practiced and demonstrated in therapy sessions with a trained profes- sional. In addition, the person learning the techniques</p>
<p>would need to continue to practice them on a regular basis, outside of the therapy sessions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="relaxation-or-progressive-relaxation-1">Relaxation or progressive relaxation</h3>
<p>In progressive relaxation, an individual is instructed to tighten and then relax various muscles. He or she either lies down or sits in a chair with his/her head supported. Each muscle group (such as face muscles, arm muscles, leg muscles, etc.) is tensed for five to seven seconds and then relaxed for 20 to 30 seconds. This helps the person recognize the feeling of tense and relaxed muscles. This entire procedure is repeated one to five times, and usually starts with the face muscles and moves downward to the foot muscles. When relaxation is used with chronic pain and child- birth, the techniques focus the person’s attention on breathing and relaxing muscles as a distraction from the pain. For mastery, relaxation techniques are typ- ically practiced every day for one to two weeks. A person may engage in these techniques anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour per session. Sometimes, the individual will record and replay instructions on tightening and relaxing various muscle groups until he or she becomes familiar with the muscle groups and establishes a comfortable routine.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="visualization-and-imagery-2">Visualization and imagery</h3>
<p>The basic premise behind visualization and imagery is that one’s thoughts become reality. For example, if an individual thinks anxious thoughts, then he or she will become tense. The principle of visualization and imagery is that a person can use his or her imagination to be persuaded to feel a certain way or do anything that is physically possible to do. There are three basic types of visualization: pro- grammed, receptive, and guided visualization.
In programmed visualization, the person creates a vivid image including sight, taste, sound, and smell. The individual then imagines a goal he or she wants to attain or some type of healing that is desired. In the visual- ization, the goal is achieved, or the healing occurs.
An idea underlying both receptive visualization and guided visualization is that the person is seeking an answer to a life question or resolution to an issue, and the answer or resolution is within the person, but is buried or inaccessible because of fear, doubt, or anxiety. These techniques are similar to dream inter- pretation and free association techniques used in psy- choanalysis or psychodynamic therapy. For example, an individual may wonder whether he should remain in his current job. A proponent of these techniques would maintain that ‘‘deep down,’’ below the level of
conscious thought, the man knows what he really wants to do, but he is not allowing himself to listen to his desires or to act—he is blocking the message his subconscious is sending him. The goal of these techni- ques is to enable the person to relax and focus enough to receive that message, so that he or she can do what needs to be done. In receptive visualization, the indi- vidual creates a peaceful scene in his or her mind. After the image is formed, the person asks a question and waits for the answer. To continue the example above, the man imagines a beach, and he asks himself the question, ‘‘Should I leave my job?’’ He continues to relax and remain in the scene, and he may ‘‘hear’’ an answer blowing in the breeze or ‘‘see’’ a boat sailing away, which may be symbolic of his wish to leave his job.
In guided visualization, the person creates a very vivid image, as in programmed visualization, but omits some important elements. The person then waits for the subconscious to supply the missing pieces. For example, a computer programmer may wonder if she should stay in her present job or return to school for an advanced degree. In engaging in guided visualization, she may visualize her cubicle at work, the pictures on her desk, the feel of her desk chair, the sounds of people outside her cubicle typing and talking, but she will omit an element from the scene. In this case, she may omit her computer. She will then wait to see what her sub- conscious uses to replace her computer. This woman may find in her visualization that her computer has been replaced by books, which may represent her desire to return to school.
Visualization and imagery exercises work best when a person is relaxed. Visualization and imagery exercises are typically practiced two to three times a day for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. How quickly an individual will see results can vary. Many times people report immediate symptom relief. However, the per- sonal goals a person sets, the power of a his or her imagination, and willingness to practice can all influ- ence how rapidly benefits can be obtained. Some peo- ple find it helpful to tape record and replay detailed descriptions of what they want to visualize or imagine.</p>

<h3 id="diaphragmatic-breathing-2">Diaphragmatic breathing</h3>
<p>Diaphragmatic breathing can typically be learned in minutes; however, the benefits may not be recog- nized until after several months of persistent practice. When breathing from the diaphragm, clients are often told to lie down on a rug or blanket, with their legs slightly apart, arms to the sides not touching the body, with their eyes closed. Attention is brought to the breathing by placing one hand on the chest and the other hand on the abdomen area. The client is then</p>
<p>instructed to breathe in through the nose and exhale out the mouth. Each time the client breathes in, he or she should try to breathe deeper. This should be prac- ticed for a minimum of five minutes once or twice a day. Over a few weeks of practice, the time period engaged in diaphragmatic breathing should be increased to 20 minutes and the activity can be per- formed while lying down, sitting, or standing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="stress-inoculation-2">Stress inoculation</h3>
<p>As people go about their daily lives, they often have thoughts in which they are talking to themselves. Stress inoculation involves this self-talk in helping clients decrease their anxiety and stress. Stress inocu- lation therapy works on the basis of turning the cli- ent’s own thought patterns into a ‘‘vaccine’’ against stress-induced anxiety. The first step is to develop a list of stressful situations and arrange them from least to most stressful. Once anxiety-producing situations are identified, the client is taught to curb the anxiety- provoking thoughts and replace them with more pos- itive coping thoughts. Once these new thoughts are learned, they can be tried out in real situations. The time it takes to replace old habitual thoughts with new thoughts can vary depending on the amount of prac- tice and commitment to make this change.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="meditation-2">Meditation</h3>
<p>There are various forms of meditation. Depend- ing on the type used, the individual focuses his or her attention in slightly different ways. For example, Zen meditation focuses on breathing, whereas in transcen- dental meditation, the person makes a sound or says a mantra selected to keep all other images and problems from intruding on his or her thoughts. With practice, a person can reach a meditative state and obtain its benefits within a few minutes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="aftercare">Aftercare</h3>
<p>After a person has learned and practiced anxiety reduction techniques, he or she may need additional instruction from a trained professional. Having a trained professional review these techniques can help reinforce what the person has already learned and been practicing. Furthermore, the person may identify aspects of the techniques that he or she is doing incor- rectly, areas that need more attention or focus, and alternative methods of engaging in the techniques.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="risks">Risks</h3>
<p>There are minimal risks associated with these tech- niques, but some physical problems have occurred. For
example, precautions should be taken when doing pro- gressive relaxation and tensing the neck and back. Excessive tightening can create muscle or spinal dam- age. Additionally, tightening various muscle groups, such as the toes or feet, could result in muscle cramps. If physical problems occur, such as difficulty taking deep breaths, unusual muscle pain, or an increased level of anxiety, then the individual should seek assis- tance from a physician.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="normal-results">Normal results</h3>
<p>In general, after engaging in these anxiety reduc- tion techniques, many people report an increased sense of well-being and relaxation. People have a greater sense of control, and confidence in their coping abilities. This results in a decreased need to fear or avoid stressful situations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="relaxation-or-progressive-relaxation-2">Relaxation or progressive relaxation</h3>
<p>Progressive relaxation can be useful in reducing muscle tension. Engaging in relaxation may help to improve a person’s energy level, depression, and anxi- ety, as well as the ability to retrieve information from memory.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="visualization-and-imagery-3">Visualization and imagery</h3>
<p>By engaging in the positive thinking often associ- ated with visualization and imagery, a person can cre- ate a clearer image of what he or she wants to accomplish. By repeating the image again and again, the individual comes to expect what he or she wants will occur. As a result, the person will often begin to act in a way more consistent with accomplishing the goal.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="diaphragmatic-breathing-3">Diaphragmatic breathing</h3>
<p>Sufficient amounts of air reach the lungs, which purifies and oxygenates the blood. Waste products in the blood are removed, and organs and tissues become nourished.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="stress-inoculation-3">Stress inoculation</h3>
<p>A person will have more realistic views of stressful and anxiety-producing situations in his or her life. The individual will be able to relax away tension by effec- tively thinking useful coping thoughts rather than negative interpretations of situations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="meditation-3">Meditation</h3>
<p>As people learn to meditate, they often discover that they have some control over the thoughts that come to their minds, as opposed to feeling as though thoughts ‘‘pop’’ into their heads. Many people begin</p>
