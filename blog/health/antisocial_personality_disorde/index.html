<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
<p>Also known as psychopathy, sociopathy, or dis- social personality disorder, antisocial personality dis- order (APD) is a diagnosis applied to persons who routinely behave with little or no regard for the rights, safety, or feelings of others. This pattern of behavior is seen in children or young adolescents and can persist into adulthood.
The most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (the fourth edition, text revision or DSM-IV-TR) classifies APD as one of four ‘‘Cluster B Personality Disorders’’ along with borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personal- ity disorders.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Men or women diagnosed with this personality disorder demonstrate few emotions beyond contempt for other people. Their lack of empathy is often com- bined with an inflated sense of self-worth and a superficial charm that tends to mask an inner indifference to the needs or feelings of others. Some studies indicate that people with APD can only mimic the emotions associated with committed love relationships and friendships that most people feel naturally.
People reared by parents with antisocial person- ality disorder or substance abuse disorders are more likely to develop APD than members of the general population. People with the disorder may be homeless, living in poverty, suffering from a concurrent sub- stance abuse disorder, or piling up extensive criminal records, as antisocial personality disorder is associated with low socioeconomic status and urban back- grounds. Highly intelligent individuals with APD, however, may not come to the attention of the crimi- nal justice or mental health care systems and may be underrepresented in diagnostic statistics.
Some legal experts and mental health professionals do not think that APD should be classified as a mental disorder on the grounds that the classification appears to excuse unethical, illegal, or immoral behavior. Despite these concerns, juries in the United States have consistently demonstrated that they do not regard a diagnosis of APD as exempting a person from pros- ecution or punishment for crimes committed.
Furthermore, some experts disagree with the cate- gorization by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) of antisocial personality disorder. The APA considers the term ‘‘psychopathy’’ as another, synon- ymous name for APD. However, some experts make a distinction between psychopathy and APD. Dr. Robert Hare, an authority on psychopathy and the originator of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, claims that all psychopaths have APD but not all individuals diag- nosed with APD are psychopaths. Recent reports have made this distinction even clearer, suggesting that there is emotional deficit component of psychopathy that is not necessarily present in people with APD. One expert review comments that only 25% of people diagnosed with APD or the putatively related ‘‘conduct disorder’’ will show psychopathic tendencies.</p>
<h3 id="causes-and-symptoms">Causes and symptoms</h3>
<p>Studies of adopted children indicate that both genetic and environmental factors influence the</p>
<h3 id="antisocial-personality-disorder">Antisocial personality disorder</h3>
<p>development of APD, with heritability estimates rang- ing from 44% to 72%. Both biological and adopted children of people diagnosed with the disorder have an increased risk of developing it. Children born to parents diagnosed with APD but adopted into other families resemble their biological more than their adoptive parents in this regard. The environment of the adoptive home, however, may lower the child’s risk of developing APD.
Researchers have linked antisocial personality disorder to childhood physical or sexual abuse, neuro- logical disorders (which are often undiagnosed), and low IQ. Some experts have recently questioned the link between psychopathy, which these experts distinguish from APD, and early environmental trauma. As with other personality disorders, no one has identified any specific cause or causes of antisocial personality disorder. Indeed, one group with the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health has stated that ‘‘there are many developmental routes to an elevated risk for antisocial behavior.’’ Persons diagnosed with APD also have an increased incidence of somatization dis- order and substance-related disorders.
The DSM-IV-TR adds that persons who show signs of conduct disorder with accompanying attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder before the age of 10 have a greater chance of being diagnosed with APD as adults than do other children. The manual notes that abuse or neglect combined with erratic parenting or inconsistent discipline appears to increase the risk that a child diag- nosed with conduct disorder will develop APD as an adult.
Brain imaging studies have identified some spe- cific characteristics in the brains of people diagnosed with APD that suggest dysfunction of structures in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.</p>
<h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h3>
<p>The central characteristic of antisocial personality disorder is an extreme disregard for the rights of other people. Individuals with APD lie and cheat to gain money or power. Their disregard for authority often leads to arrest and imprisonment. Because they have little regard for others and may act impulsively, they are frequently involved in fights. They show loyalty to few if any other people and are likely to seek power over others in order to satisfy sexual desires or eco- nomic needs.
People with APD often become effective ‘‘con artists.’’ Those with well-developed verbal abilities can often charm and fool their victims, including unsuspecting or inexperienced therapists. People with
APD have no respect for what others regard as societal norms or legal constraints. They may quit jobs on short notice, move to another city, or end relationships without warning and without what others would con- sider good reason. Criminal activities typically include theft, selling illegal drugs, and check fraud. Because persons with antisocial personality disorder make ‘‘looking out for number one’’ their highest priority, they are quick to exploit others. They commonly rationalize these actions by dismissing their victims as weak, stupid, or unwary.
Some work has been done on the relationship between what are called ‘‘minor physical anomalies’’ and the presence of various disorders, including aggression disorders and psychopathy. The presence of these features—which include low-seated ears and adherent ear lobes—is associated with developmental derailments in the fetus at the end of the third trimester of pregnancy, and they have been linked with the development of conduct disorder and violence in adulthood. Studies directly examining their associa- tion, if any, with psychopathy or APD are lacking. Birth complications are known risk factors for violent, antisocial behaviors.</p>
<h3 id="demographics">Demographics</h3>
<p>APD is estimated to affect 3% of males and 1% of females in the general population of the United States. Mental health professionals may diagnose 3–30% of the population in clinical settings as having the disor- der. The percentages may be even higher among prison inmates or persons in treatment for substance abuse. By some estimates, three-quarters of the prison population may meet the diagnostic criteria for APD.</p>
<h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>
<p>The diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is usually based on a combination of a careful medical as well as psychiatric history and an interview with the patient. The doctor will look for recurrent or repetitive patterns of antisocial behavior. He or she may use a diagnostic questionnaire for APD, such as the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised or the self-reporting Psychopathic Personality Inventory, if the patient’s history suggests the diagnosis. A person aged 18 years or older with a childhood history of disregard for the rights of others can be diagnosed as having APD if he or she gives evidence of three of the following seven behaviors associated with disregard for others:
􏰀 Fails to conform to social norms, as indicated by frequently performing illegal acts or pursuing illegal occupations.</p>
