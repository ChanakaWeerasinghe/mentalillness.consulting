[{"categories":["Health"],"contents":"Definition Temazepam is a drug that belongs to a family of drugs known as benzodiazepines. Temazepam is sold under the brand name Restoril in the United States. Temazepam is also available as a generic.\nPurpose Temazepam is given to patients with sleeping problems (insomnia). It is often prescribed for insomnia characterized by frequent awakening during the night or by awakening early in the morning.\nDescription Temazepam is one of several drugs in the class known as benzodiazepines. These drugs produce a variety of effects, but most cause some degree of drowsiness (sedation). Temazepam is used almost exclusively as a hypnotic, or drug given to help people fall asleep. It is nearly always taken just before bed- time. This drug produces its effects in the body by slowing down certain impulses in the brain, allowing the patient to fall asleep.\nRecommended dosage The typical dose starting for adults is 7.5–15 mg taken just before bedtime. The maximum recommended dose is 30 mg Elderly patients and those in a weakened condition may need only 7.5 mg. The doctor should determine the dose in children 18 years of age and younger on an individual basis.\nPrecautions The doctor should monitor any patient taking this drug to ensure that significant side effects do not develop. Insomnia that lasts longer than 7–10 days may point to a significant medical problem that should be thoroughly evaluated. Temazepam should not be combined with alcohol or other drugs that lower the level of activity in the central nervous system. Examples of such drugs include prescription pain medications, antihistamines, barbiturates, muscle relaxants.\nSome persons may develop dizziness lightheadedness clumsiness after taking temazepam.\nThese side effects are especially common in the elderly. Persons with a history of anemia, liver disease, kidney disease, drug abuse, serious psychological dis- orders, and suicide attempts should be given temaz pam only after being thoroughly evaluated by their physician. This caution also applies to persons with a history of lung disease, seizure disorders, and narrowangle glaucoma. People who are taking temazepam should not stop taking it abruptly. Instead, the dose should be reduced gradually.\nWithdrawal symptoms  Including depressed mood weating Abdominal cramps Muscle cramps Vomiting Seizures Shakiness can develop if the medication is stopped suddenly  Although patients are instructed to take temaze- pam in the evening before bedtime, they often experi- ence side effects the next day, particularly drowsiness and loss of coordination or clumsiness. Pregnant women should not use this drug because it increases the risk of birth defects in the baby. Nursing mothers should not be given temazepam because it can make their babies drowsy and unable to nurse properly. Patients should not operate heavy machinery or drive a car while they are taking temazepam or any other benzodiazepine.\nSide effects Temazepam is a relatively safe drug, safer than most of the benzodiazepines. Its less serious but more common side effects include\nclumsiness or unsteady behavior, dizziness, drowsiness, and slurred speech.\nSome patients taking temazepam experience  abdominal cramps, Dry mouth Constipation Diarrhea Headache Nausea Vomiting A giddy sense of well-being, Changes in sexual drive.  A small number of patients taking temazepam have experienced  Anger outbursts, Confusion, Mental depression, Unusually low blood pressure, Memory difficulties, Nervousness, Irritability, Muscle weakness.  Symptoms of a temazepam overdose include  Extreme drowsiness, Significant confusion, 3.Breathing difficulties, A very slow heart- beat, Staggering.  Rebound insomnia is one of the more common side effects of tapering a patient’s dose of temazepam. Rebound insomnia is a reaction characterized by the re-emergence of the symptom that the drug was orig- inally given to suppress, namely problems with falling or staying asleep. When a person takes a medication for sleep on a regular basis, the body adjusts to the presence of the drug. It tries to counteract the effects of the medication. As a result, when the person stops taking the sleeping medication, the body will take a few nights to return to its normal condition. During this period of readjustment, the person may experience a few sleepless hours each night. In addition, people often mistake the rebound insomnia for the ordinary variety, and consider it a good reason to continue taking the temazepam. People can also develop withdrawal symptoms even when they are gradually decreasing their dose of\nJack Raber, Pharm.D. Ruth A. Wienclaw, PhD Resources BOOKS Consumer Reports Staff.

The anxiety associated with agoraphobia leads to avoidance of situations that involve being outside one’s home alone, being in crowds, being on a bridge, or traveling by car or public transportation. Agoraphobia may intensify to the point that it interferes with a person’s ability to take a job outside the home or to carry out such ordinary errands and activities as shopping for groceries or going out to a movie\nSymptoms The symptoms of an episode of agoraphobia may include any or all of the following:\n trembling breaking out in sweat heart palpitations paresthesias (tingling or ‘‘pins and needles’’ sensations in the hands or feet) nausea fatigue rapid pulse or breathing rate a sense of impending doom  In most cases, the person with agoraphobia feels some relief from the symptoms after he or she has left the precipitating situation or returned home. People with agoraphobia People with agoraphobia appear to have two distinct types of anxiety—panic, and the anticipatory anxiety related to fear of future panic attacks. Patients with agoraphobia are sometimes able to endure being in the situations they fear by ‘‘gritting their teeth,’’ or by having a friend or relative accompany them. In the United States’ diagnostic system, the symptoms of agoraphobia can be similar to those of specific phobia and social phobia. In agoraphobia and specific phobia, the focus is fear itself; with social phobia, the person’s focus is on how others are perceiving him/her. Patients diagnosed with agoraphobia tend to be more afraid of their own internal physical sensations and similar cues than of the reactions of others per se.\n In cases of specific phobia,  the person fears very specific situations, whereas in agoraphobia, the person generally fears a variety of situations (being outside of the home alone or traveling on public transportation, for example). An example of a patient diagnosed with a specific phobia rather than agoraphobia would be the person whose fear is triggered only by being in a bus, rather than a car or taxi. The fear of the bus is more specific than the fear of traveling on public transportation in general, which may be experienced by a person with agoraphobia.\nCauses and symptoms Currently, the causes of agoraphobia are complex and not completely understood. Research indicates several factors can contribute to the condition.\nGENETIC. It has been known for some years that anxiety disorders tend to run in families. Recent research has confirmed earlier hypotheses that there is a genetic component to agoraphobia, and that it can be separated from susceptibility to PD.\nINNATE TEMPERAMENT. A number of researchers have pointed to inborn temperament as a broad vulnerability factor in the development of anxiety and mood disorders. In other words, a person’s natural disposition or temperament may become a factor in developing a number of mood or anxiety disorders. Some people seem more sensitive throughout their lives to events, but upbringing and life history are also important factors in determining who will develop these disorders. Children who manifest what is known as ‘‘behavioral inhibition’’ (a group of behaviors that are displayed when the child is confronted with a new situation or unfamiliar people) in early infancy are at increased risk for developing more than one anxiety disorder in adult life—particularly if the inhibition remains over time.\nPHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIONS TO ILLNESS. Another factor in the development of PD and agoraphobia appears to be a history of respiratory disease. Some researchers have hypothesized that repeated episodes of respiratory disease would predispose a child to PD by making breathing difficult and lowering the threshold for feeling suffocated. It is also possible that respiratory diseases could generate fearful beliefs in the child’s mind that would lead him or her to exaggerate the significance of respiratory symptoms. LIFE EVENTS. About 42% of patients diagnosed with agoraphobia report histories of real or feared separation from their parents or other caretakers in childhood. This statistic has been interpreted to mean that agoraphobia in adults is the aftermath of unresolved childhood separation anxiety. The fact that many patients diagnosed with agoraphobia report that their first episode occurred after the death of a loved one, and the observation that other people with agorophobia feel safe in going out as long as someone is with them, have been taken as supportive evidence of the separation anxiety hypothesis.\nLEARNED BEHAVIOR. There are also theories about human learning that explain agoraphobia. It is thought that a person’s initial experience of paniclike symptoms in a specific situation—for example, being alone in a subway station—may lead the person to associate physical symptoms of panic with all subway stations. Avoiding all subway stations would then reduce the level of the person’s discomfort. Unfortunately, the avoidance strengthens the phobia because the person is unlikely to have the opportunity to test whether subway stations actually cause uncomfortable physical sensations. One treatment modality— exposure therapy—is based on the premise that phobias can be ‘‘unlearned’’ by reversing the pattern of avoidance.\nSOCIAL FACTORS RELATED TO GENDER. Gender role socialization has been suggested as an explanation for the fact that the majority of patients with agoraphobia are women. One form of this hypothesis maintains that some parents still teach girls to be fearful and timid about venturing out in public. Another version relates agoraphobia to the mother-daughter relationship, maintaining that mothers tend to give daughters mixed messages about becoming separate individuals. As a result, girls grow up with a more fragile sense of self, and may stay within the physical boundaries of their home because they lack a firm sense of their internal psychological boundaries.\nTreatments Treatment of agoraphobia usually consists of medication plus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The physician may also recommend an alternative form of treatment for the anxiety symptoms associated with agoraphobia. Some patients may be advised to cut down on or give up coffee or tea, as the caffeine in these beverages can be contribute to their panic symptoms.\nMedications Medications that have been used with patients diagnosed with agoraphobia include the benzodiazepine tranquilizers, the MAO inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and the selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. In the past few years, the SSRIs have come to be regarded as the firstchoice medication treatment because they have fewer side effects. The benzodiazepines have the disadvantage of increasing the symptoms of agoraphobia when they are withdrawn, as well as interfering with CBT.\nMental Health Care An Introduction for Health Professionals in Australia  Youtube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/resource/health/agoraphobia_symptoms_causes_diagnosis_and_outlook/","tags":["health"],"title":"Agoraphobia: Symptoms,causes,diagnosis"},{"categories":["Health"],"contents":"Amantadine Amantadine is a synthetic antiviral agent that also has strong antiparkinsonian properties. It is sold in the United States under the brand name Symmetrel, and is also available under its generic name.\nPurpose Amantadine is used to treat a group of side effects (called parkinsonian side effects) that include tremors, difficulty walking, and slack muscle tone. These side effects may occur in patients who are taking antipsy- chotic medications used to treat mental disorders such as schizophrenia. An unrelated use of amantadine is in the treatment of viral infections of some strains of influenza A.\nDescription Some medicines, called antipsychotic drugs, that are used to treat schizophrenia and other mental dis- orders can cause side effects similar to the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. The patient does not have Parkinson’s disease, but may experience shaking in muscles while at rest, difficulty with voluntary move- ments, and poor muscle tone. One way to eliminate these undesirable side effects is to stop taking the antipsychotic medicine. Unfortunately, the symptoms of the original mental disorder usually come back, so in most cases simply stopping the antipsychotic medication is not a reasonable option. Some drugs that control the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease such as amantadine also control the parkinsonian side effects of antipsychotic medicines. Amantadine works by restoring the chemical balance between dopamine and acetylcholine, two neurotransmitter chemicals in the brain. Taking amantadine along with the antipsychotic medicine helps to control symptoms of the mental disorder, while reducing parkinsonian side effects. Amantadine is in the same family of drugs (commonly known as anticholinergic drugs) as biperiden and trihexyphenidyl.\nRecommended dosage Amantadine is available in 100-mg tablets and capsules, as well as a syrup containing 50 mg of aman- tadine in each teaspoonful. For the treatment of drug- induced parkinsonian side effects, amantadine is usually given in a dose of 100 mg orally twice a day. Some patients may need a total daily dose as high as 300 mg. Patients who are taking other antiparkinsonian drugs at the same time may require lower daily doses of amantadine (e.g., 100 mg daily). People with kidney disease or who are on hemo- dialysis must have their doses lowered. In these patients, doses may range from 100 mg daily to as little as 200 mg every seven days.\nPrecautions Amantadine increases the amount of the neuro- transmitter dopamine (a central nervous system stimu- lant) in the brain. Because of this, patients with a history of epilepsy or other seizure disorders should be carefully monitored while taking this drug. This is especially true in the elderly and in patients with kidney disease. Amantadine may cause visual disturbances and affect mental alertness and coordination. People should not operate dangerous machinery or motor vehicles while taking this drug.\nSide effects Five to ten percent of patientstaking amantadine may experience the following nervous system side effects.\n Dizziness or lightheadedness insomnia. Nervousness or anxiety. Impaired concentration.  One to five percent of patients taking amantadine may experience the following nervous system side effects:\n Irritability or agitation depression. Confusion.  Lack of coordination. Sleepiness or nightmares fatigue. Headache.  In addition, up to 1% of patients may experience hallucinations, euphoria (excitement), extreme forget- fulness, aggressive behavior, personality changes, or seizures. Seizures are the most serious of all the side effects associated with amantadine. Gastrointestinal side effects may also occur in patients taking amantadine. Up to 10% of people taking this drug experience nausea and up to 5% have dry mouth, loss of appetite, constipation, and vomiting. In most situations, amantadine may be con- tinued and these side effects treated symptomatically. Between 1% and 5% of patients taking amanta- dine have also reported a bluish coloring of their skin (usually on the legs) that is associated with enlargement of the blood vessels (called livedo reticularis). This side effect usually appears within one month to one year of starting the drug and subsides within weeks to months after the drug is discontinued. People who think they may be experiencing this or other side effects from any medication should tell their physicians.\nInteractions Taking amantadine along with other drugs used to treat parkinsonian side effects may cause increased confusion or even hallucinations.

It is sold in the United States under the brand names Elavil and Endep. Purpose Amitriptyline helps relieve depression and pain. This medication, usually given at bedtime, also helps patients sleep better.\nDescription This medication is one of several tricyclic antide- pressants, so-called because of the three-ring chemical structure common to these drugs. Amitriptyline acts to block reabsorption of neurotransmitters (chemicals that transmit nerve messages in the brain). Amitripty- line and the other tricyclic antidepressants are primar- ily used to treat mental depression but are increasingly being replaced by a newer and more effective group of antidepressant drugs called selective serotonin reup- take inhibitors (SSRIs). Amitriptyline is sometimes prescribed to help treat pain associated with cancer. In addition, it is sometimes prescribed for various types of chronic pain. Tablets are available in 10, 25, 50, 70, and 150 mg.\nRecommended dosage The usual adult dose for pain management ranges from 10 mg to 150 mg at bedtime. Patients are generally started on a low dose and the amount may be increased as needed. Side effects, such as a dry mouth and drowsiness, may make it difficult to increase the dose in older adults. Bedtime dosing helps the patient sleep. Doctors generally prescribe 75–150 mg for depression. It is given at bedtime or in divided doses during the day. It may take 30 days for the patient to feel less depressed. Pain relief is usually noticed sooner than the mood change. Teens and older adults usually receive a lower dose. If the nightly dose is missed, it should not be taken the next morning. Taking amitriptyline during waking hours could result in noticeable side effects. Patients should check with their doctors if the daily dose is missed. Those on more than one dose per day should take a missed dose as soon as it is remembered but should not take two doses at the same time. While amitriptyline is usually admin- istered orally, injectable amitriptyline is available. It should not be used in this form long-term; patients should switch to tablets as soon as possible.\nPrecautions Patients should not stop taking this medication suddenly. The dose should gradually be decreased, then discontinued. If the drug is stopped abruptly, the patient may experience headache, nausea, or dis- comfort throughout the body, and a worsening of original symptoms.

This medication should not be given to children under 12 years of age. Pregnant women should discuss the risks and benefits of this medication with their doctors, as fetal deformities have been asso- ciated with taking this drug during pregnancy.\nWomen should not breastfeed while using amitriptyline.\nSide effects Common side effects include\n dry mouth drowsiness constipation dizziness lightheadedness when standing.  *. Patients can suck on ice cubes or sugarless hard candy to combat the dry mouth. *. Increased fiber in the diet and additional fluids may help relieve constipation.\nDizziness is usually caused by a drop in blood pressure when suddenly changing position. Patients should slowly rise from a sitting or lying position if dizziness is noticed. Amitriptyline may increase the risk of falls in older adults. Patients should not drive or operate machinery or appliances while under the influence of this drug. Alcohol and other central nervous system depressants can increase drowsiness. Amitriptyline may also produce blurry vision, irregular or fast heartbeat, high or low blood pressure, palpitations, and an increase or decrease in a diabetic patient’s blood sugar levels. Patients’ skin may become more sensitive to the sun and thus direct sunlight should be avoided by wearing protective clothing and the application of sunscreen with a pro- tective factor of 15 or higher.\n*. Amitriptyline may increase appetite, cause weight gain, or produce an unpleasant taste in the mouth. It may also cause diarrhea, vomiting, or heartburn. T aking this medication with food may decrease digestive side effects\nOther less likely side effects include  Muscle tremors Nervousness Nmpaired sexual function Sweating Rash Itching Hair loss Ringing in the ears Or changes in the makeup of the patient’s blood patients with schizophrenia may develop an increase in psychiatric symptoms.  Interactions Patients should always tell all doctors and dentists that they are taking this medication. It may decrease the effectiveness of some drugs used to treat high blood pressure and should not be taken with other antidepressants, epinephrine and other adrenaline- type drugs, or methylphenidate. Patients should not take over-the-counter medications without checking with their doctors. For instance, amitriptyline should not be taken with Tagamet (cimetidine) or Neosy- nephrine. Patients taking amitriptyline should avoid the dietary supplements St. John’s wort, belladonna, henbane, and scopolia. Black tea may decrease the absorption of this drug. Patients should ingest the drug and tea at least two hours apart. See also Depression and depressive disorders; Pharmacotherapy.\nJack Raber, Pharm.D. Ruth A.

Mental health is an internal state when the soul is open to people and the world, cheerful and joyful, d oes not suffer pain and does not suffer from hostility . This is a good mood, vigor and energy, an interest in life and an inner feeling of \u0026ldquo;Good.\u0026rdquo; A mentally healthy person is adequate, positive and friendly. He lives in a high emotional tone, he likes a reasonable level of tension, life for him is a beautiful and beloved one.\nMental health is not happiness itself, but its ** prerequisite**. Short experiences of happiness are possible against the background of mental illness, happiness lasting is possible only in a mentally healthy person .\nIt must be taken into account that many people have enough mental health, and experiencing happiness is pleasant for them, but no more. As a man, for example, I want to eat something meat, and the cakes for him are tasty, but rather unnecessary.\nThe opposite of mental health is an unstable, lowered or directly bad mood, the ease of falling into a negative, and the difficulty of getting out of a negative. Resentment, fears, irritation, fatigue, inability to endure life stress \u0026hellip; Low emotional tone, hostility, bitterness, lack of interest in life, problem psychosomatics and problem psychological defenses are signs of weakening mental health. Neurosis and depression are already a clear mental illness, although, perhaps, still within the framework of a healthy psyche.\nYoung children, as a rule, are very mentally healthy. But a human-child, as a rule, is neurotic. The tendency to insults, accusations, inability to control one’s feelings and desires are not indicators of mental health. One cannot underestimate, but one should not overestimate the importance of mental health. The brilliance of the mind, leadership talent, courage and other virtues can both decorate a mentally healthy person, and it can be absent. A mentally healthy person is not necessarily a genius and a saint. This may be a spiritless person with low intelligence and disgusting manners.\nYes it can be. But more often, upbringing and mental health are interconnected. A mentally healthy person easily becomes well-mannered, good manners contribute to good mental health ↑ .\nWhat is the path to mental health? Mental health can and should be gained. Mental health is promoted by the habit of a healthy lifestyle , the ability to relax , a positive worldview , responsibility without guilt , adulthood and, oddly enough, extravert . But introversion, especially self-digging , anxious walking to doctors and psychotherapists categorically does not add mental health. There is an alarming sign - the more a person knows about the existence of mental illness and childhood injuries - the more he usually finds them in himself.\nLike Jerome-Jerome: “And I realized that my liver is out of order \u0026hellip;”\nAnd here is a simple exercise and shower in the morning, early release and lifting, good training and regular physical activity, a hardened body, the habit of thinking well about people and not reducing life to the navel of the earth to your beloved and to your deep and grave injuries of an unhappy childhood, openness to the world and people, care about the people around - just very much contribute to health.\nAnd who loves more difficult puzzles than just gaining mental health, he will think about his personal life mission .

If the boy is tired, he will complain that he rubbed his leg. If a girl does not want to do homework, she will talk about nasty classmates who have terribly offended her. If today we are not in the mood to solve the problems that confront us, it is a great temptation to get away from solving them, explaining our unwillingness to strain ourselves with the difficult circumstances of the past, which caused you unhealed wounds. Which are now called psychological trauma. I do not want to say that there are no psychological injuries at all. I want to say that if it’s possible to write off something on them, a long line of people who want to instantly builds up, and psychological injuries are written on the fly. And then to figure out where the difficult truth is, and where the cheap craftiness is very difficult. Nevertheless, let's try to figure it out!\nThe reader writes: “My friend (she is already 40 years old) is afraid to be alone in the dark. Logically, she understands that it’s okay. But physiologically, her pulse, breathing quickens, etc. They began to look for the reason \u0026hellip; Finally she remembered that when she was punished in childhood, she was locked in the pantry and the lights were turned off there. Such is the punishment for life \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;- All children love to shut themselves up in the dark and be afraid: their heart rate quickens at this time, breathing is normal stress, normal children's entertainment . An adult woman has the same reaction, mild stress and mild fear, which does not entail any real trouble. If we speak the language of injuries, then there is a scratch, not a serious injury. Mild stress is not a problem. On the other hand, if you want, you can make a problem out of anything, including mild stress. And also note\nAnother: \u0026ldquo;My sister is afraid of heights. The reason is that in the primary classes in the library I got out and leafed through books on the stepladder. The stepladder rocked very hard and she almost fell \u0026hellip; Frightened VERY.\u0026rdquo; Anyone can be frightened when he unexpectedly falls off a stepladder, but if you do not make this tragedy, the fright disappears in a couple of minutes. As for the fear of heights, this fear is inherent in almost everyone, and for this you do not need to fall from the stepladder. Yes, looking down from the roof of a 20-story building is scary. Why do you need to approach the edge of the roof? And also: \u0026ldquo;If you talk to girls of easy virtue, it turns out that more than half of them suffered sexual abuse in childhood. Psychological trauma? Yes.\u0026rdquo; If you communicate with girls of easy virtue, it turns out that more than half of them grew up in more than problem families, watched a lot of things and looked for sexual adventures at a very young age. The result is not psychological trauma, but bad parenting.\nSo, while it can be stated: at least in the ordinary consciousness, any circumstances that can justify the position of the Victim are considered as a trauma. Accordingly, if we omit from science to life, then psycho-trauma is an emotionally loaded household pseudo-concept , to which all the unfortunate people who remember about it in time are happy to refer. And then the psychological trauma is understood as this harm caused to the mental health of a person by adverse circumstances or human actions.\nAnd in science, psychological trauma is a hypothetical reason for inadequate behavior in a healthy psyche, associated with difficult, painful events that have occurred in a person’s life. Or - immersion in mental illness for reasons that others perceive as respectful.\nPsycho-injury fashion Again a deuce \u0026hellip; Probably, you need to feel sorry for the boy: it's a typical trauma! Again a deuce \u0026hellip; Probably, you need to feel sorry for the boy: it's a typical trauma!\nAt the end of the 19th century, any decent girl at least once every few years necessarily fainted from experiences. Today there is no such fashion. At the beginning of the 20th century, all psychiatrists studied hysterical seizures with convulsions, today this fashion has sunk into history . Today in the yard is a new fashion, a fashion for psycho-injuries.\nUntil the 80s, no one knew about psychotrauma or spoke, no one was afraid of trauma. With the development of crisis psychology, the concept of \u0026ldquo;psychotrauma\u0026rdquo; has become popular, psychotrauma of children is now scaring parents, smart children and smart parents are actively manipulating the threat of possible trauma.\nWe already have cell phones in the class! If you don’t buy me a mobile phone, everyone will laugh at me, and I will get a trauma!\nThey used to say: I came in a bad mood, He returned angry and upset. Now they say more solidly: Be careful, he has a trauma!\nAs a result of the massive impact of talking about the dangers of psychological trauma, many readers of psychological literature are poisoned by the thought that our whole life is due to our childhood injuries. Our parents really play a decisive role in our development, parents are responsible for our upbringing, but they are not responsible for what we are now. Today I am already an adult, and what happens to me is already my responsibility. Only by accepting this responsibility can a person grow up .\nWe can agree that there are people who are prone to psycho-injuries, leading such a lifestyle and having such tendencies that psycho-traumas simply stick to them. This is a person-child (a person who often shows the features of a child’s position in thinking, emotional reactions and behavior), and even more often - an experienced person (adding up the characteristics of a neurotic and a person-child). As for the personality of the hysterical plan, then to compose yourself a psycho-injury for any reason, for them it is not easy - simple, but real joy.\nHow to prevent real and imaginary psychological trauma? The recipes are simple: \n removing anatomical negativity healthy lifestyle developing a positive worldview 4 .developing adulthood 5 . which primarily includes responsibility 6 .habit and the ability to be needed.  Do psychotherapy work in psychotherapy? The question seems strange, in fact it is very important. Psychotrauma can very well be a reality\ncircumstances:\n natural disaster, mass deaths of people, including the death of children, and everything happens before the eyes of the mother  and then work with psychotrauma can be necessary and justified. However, there are frequent cases when they seek (and find) a trauma where it does not exist, to the complete joy of both the client (he justifies his helplessness) and the psychotherapist (he received a long client).\nHow to prevent this? See How to work with internal problems . The diagnosis of \u0026ldquo;trauma\u0026rdquo; should only be made in cases where there are no other reasonable assumptions. Important: mental and psychological trauma are not the same thing. Mental trauma is damage (by someone or something) to the psyche, leading to a noticeable violation of its normal functioning. A person ceases to recognize loved ones attention swims speech with strangeness memory gaps,\nthinking becomes confused \u0026hellip; With psychological trauma, there are no mental disorders - the person still has the opportunity to be adequate and successfully adapt to the environment.\nThe main complaint to the \u0026ldquo;concept\u0026rdquo; of psychological trauma is the absence of both a strict definition and any criteria for the presence or absence of psychological trauma. In the medical literature the concept of psychotrauma is absent . There are no observed signs of psychotrauma. Criteria for causing psychological trauma - no. The emergence of any strong feeling of a negative plan can be interpreted as psychological trauma caused by people or circumstances. Accordingly, almost any Masha can accuse some Vasya of causing her trauma if, after talking with him, her mood has deteriorated, especially for a long time. After all, the harm to her mental health was done?\nDespite the fact that there are no clear, observable criteria for psychological trauma, instead of criteria, they often indicate signs of psychological trauma. How thorough these signs are, let us give our opinion to a respected reader. So,\nThe presence of an event that is rated as a strong blow . The unexpected loss of a very dear person, rape, for a child - an unexpected divorce of parents (in the presence of very close emotional ties with both).\nIt seems reasonable, however, this criterion cannot be recognized as objective, since the significance of the event is a very subjective matter, depending on the culture of the local and concrete person. Wise people are ready for anything (See Mental insurance ), and a human child is ready to arrange sincere tantrums because of any trifle. As for children, will every child perceive as a blow the rape or divorce of their parents? It turns out not: the data say that the perception of this is very individual and to a greater extent depends on those scenarios that are prompted to the child by the environment.\nThe obsession of memories . The average fading time of obsessive memories in a healthy person is three days. If a person returns to the experience again and again, after a week, a month, or even years, and more and more new (and past events) are now seen through the prism of the negative trauma - this is an important sign of psychological trauma.\nIt also seems reasonable, but again it cannot be recognized as an objective criterion. Long-term obsession with memories may not speak of psychological trauma, but of a person’s bad habit of living with negative experiences and memories. There are many such people, people with a habit of negative perception of the world perceive everything through the prism of negativity without any trauma, and if they still don’t know what to do, then this is a natural way of life for them, and they constantly occupy themselves with difficult memories: watch a fragment from the film \u0026ldquo;Amelie.\u0026rdquo;\nEngagement . A person does not separate himself and the situation that led to the trauma, cannot distance himself from her, look at what happened calmly, from the side. He perceives everything personally, thinking about the situation, a person thinks about himself and vice versa. He seemed to have merged with this situation.\nAt the same time, many live so constantly, they basically have no habit of considering the situation from the side. They will perceive any trifle - personally. It is not the ability to separate oneself from what has happened that speaks more often than not of psychological trauma, but of an insufficient level of development of the subject.\npsychologos psychologos\n","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/resource/health/wha_is_psychological_trauma/","tags":["Trauma"],"title":"What is Psychological Trauma How To Face it"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The number one rule of helping people should be to find out what’s actually valuable to someone.

Mental fitness situations account for 16% of the worldwide burden of sickness and harm in humans elderly 10–19 years. Half of all mental fitness conditions begin by using 14 years of age but maximum instances are undetected and untreated (1). Globally, depression is one of the main causes of illness and `isability among kids. Suicide is the third leading reason of death in 15-19-year-olds. The results of not addressing adolescent mental fitness situations expand to adulthood, impairing both physical and intellectual fitness and limiting possibilities to lead enjoyable lives as adults.  Introduction Adolescence (10–19 years) is a completely unique and formative time. Multiple physical, emotional and social changes, which includes publicity to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make young people susceptible to intellectual health problems. Promoting psychological well being and protecting adolescents from adverse stories and risk factors that may impact their capability to thrive are crucial for their well-being for the duration of adolescence and for their bodily and intellectual health in adulthood.\nMental fitness determinants Adolescence is a critical length for growing and maintaining social and emotional habits vital for mental well being.\n These encompass adopting wholesome sleep patterns; taking everyday exercise; developing coping, problem-solving, interpersonal skills; gaining knowledge of to control emotions. Supportive environments inside the family, at school and inside the wider network are also important.  An anticipated 10–20% of teenagers globally enjoy mental fitness conditions, but these continue to be underdiagnosed and undertreated (1).\nMultiple factors decide intellectual fitness outcomes. The more threat factors teenagers are exposed to, the more the potential impact on their intellectual health. Factors which could make a contribution to stress during adolescence include a desire for extra autonomy, pressure to conform with peers, exploration of sexual identity, and increased access to and use of technology. Media influence and gender norms can exacerbate the disparity among an adolescent’s lived reality and their perceptions or aspirations for the future. Other vital determinants include the nice of their domestic lifestyles and relationships with peers. Violence (inclusive of harsh parenting and bullying) and socioeconomic problems are recognized dangers to mental health. Children and adolescents are especially at risk of sexual violence, which has a clean affiliation with adverse mental health.\nSome children are at greater danger of intellectual health situations because of their residing conditions, stigma, discrimination or exclusion, or lack of get entry to to fine help and services. These include adolescents living in humanitarian and fragile settings; youth with chronic infection, autism spectrum sickness, an highbrow disability or other neurological condition; pregnant kids, adolescent parents, or the ones in early and/or forced marriages; orphans; and young people from minority ethnic or sexual backgrounds or other discriminated groups.\nAdolescents with intellectual fitness conditions are in turn mainly liable to social exclusion, discrimination, stigma (affecting readiness to are seeking for help), instructional difficulties, risk-taking behaviours, bodily ill-health and human rights violations.\nEmotional disorders Emotional problems usually emerge for the duration of formative years. In addition to melancholy or anxiety, teenagers with emotional disorders can also revel in excessive irritability, frustration or anger. Symptoms can overlap across multiple emotional sickness with fast and unexpected adjustments in temper and emotional outbursts. Younger young people may additionally broaden emotion-associated bodily symptoms which includes stomach ache, headache or nausea.\nGlobally, depression is the fourth main reason of illness and disability amongst youngsters elderly 15–19 years and fifteenth for those aged 10–14 years. Anxiety is the ninth main reason for teens elderly 15–19 years and 6th for those aged 10–14 years. Emotional issues can profoundly have an effect on regions like schoolwork and school attendance. Social withdrawal can exacerbate isolation and loneliness. At its worse, depression can cause suicide.\nChildhood behavioural issues Childhood behavioural problems are the second main reason of sickness burden in young kids aged 10–14 years and the eleventh leading reason amongst older youth aged 15–19 years. Childhood behavioural disorders include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (characterized via issue paying attention, excessive interest and acting without regards to results, which are otherwise no longer appropriate for a person's age), and behavior sickness (with symptoms of detrimental or challenging behaviour). Childhood behavioural problems can have an effect on youth’ training and may bring about criminal behaviour.\nEating problems Eating disorders generally emerge in the course of formative years and younger adulthood. Eating problems have an effect on females more generally than males. Conditions inclusive of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge consuming sickness are characterised by way of harmful eating behaviours which include restricting calories or binge ingesting. facts-sf-ec-immutable=\u0026quot;\u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;Eating issues are unfavourable to fitness and often co-exist with melancholy, tension and/or substance misuse.\nPsychosis Conditions that consist of signs of psychosis maximum usually emerge in late childhood or early adulthood. Symptoms can consist of hallucinations or delusions. These stories can impair an adolescent’s ability to take part in daily life and schooling and regularly lead to stigma or human rights violations.\nSuicide and self-harm An predicted 62 000 young people died in 2016 due to self-harm. Suicide is the third leading cause of loss of life in older kids (15–19 years). Nearly 90% of the world’s youth live in low-or middle-profits countries and extra than 90% of adolescent suicides are among teens living in those countries. Risk factors for suicide are multifaceted, such as dangerous use of alcohol, abuse in childhood, stigma towards help-seeking, obstacles to getting access to care and get entry to to means. Communication through digital media about suicidal behaviour is an emerging concern for this age group.\nRisk-taking behaviours Many risk-taking behaviours for health, along with substance use or sexual threat taking, start in the course of adolescence. Risk-taking behaviours may be both an unhelpful strategy to address bad intellectual health and may severely effect an adolescent’s intellectual and physical health.\nWorldwide, the prevalence of episodic drinking amongst youth aged 15­–19 years turned into 13.6% in 2016, with males maximum at danger.\nThe use of tobacco and cannabis are extra concerns. In 2016, primarily based on statistics to be had from a hundred thirty nations, it become envisioned that 5.6% of 15–16-year-olds had used cannabis at least once in the preceding year (2). Many grownup people who smoke have their first cigarette previous to the age of 18 years.\nPerpetration of violence is a chance-taking behaviour which can boom the likelihood of low academic attainment, damage, involvement with crime or loss of life. Interpersonal violence was ranked the second leading cause of demise of older adolescent boys in 2016.\nPromotion and prevention Mental health promotion and prevention interventions goal to bolster individuals\u0026rsquo; capability to alter emotions, enhance options to threat-taking behaviours, construct resilience into hard situations and adversities, and sell supportive social environments and social networks.\nThese programmes require a multilevel approach with varied delivery platforms – for example, virtual media, health or social care settings, schools or the network, and numerous strategies to attain youth, especially the most inclined ones.\nEarly detection and treatment It is essential to deal with the wishes of young people with described intellectual health conditions. Avoiding institutionalization and over-medicalization, prioritizing nonpharmacological approaches, and respecting the rights of youngsters consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and other human rights devices are key for young people. WHO’s intellectual health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) presents evidence-based suggestions for non-experts to enable them to better perceive and assist priority mental health conditions in lower-resourced settings.\nYoutube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/resource/health/child_and_adolescent_mental_health/","tags":["health"],"title":"Adolescent mental health"},{"categories":["Health"],"contents":"BARBITURATES BARBITURATES are sedative drug.. used, among other purposes, to relieve anxiety and to promote sleep. They have played an increasingly important part in medical. prescribing since the early 1940s, to the extent that it is widely felt that too many people have become dependent on large daily quantities of barbiturates. Nevertheless, these drugs are immensely useful. They are classified according to the length of time in which they are believed to exert their effect in the body. Ultra-short acting barbiturates include Brietal and Pentothal. These drugs have an immediate effect of such a short duration that they can be used as general anaesthetics. An injection given into a vein in the arm reaches the brain in about 1 Oseconds, and immedi-ately produces unconsciousness. From the effect of a single injection of Brietal or Pentothal the patient will remain \u0026lsquo;out\u0026rsquo; for several minutes, but in most operations, it is the practice to administer, in addition, an anaesthetic gas. Pentothal is widely referred to as \u0026lsquo;truth serum\u0026rsquo;. Of course, it is nothing of the kind, and the belief that people who are anaesthetized with it sud-denly divulge their innermost secrets is nonsense. All that can be said is that if a dilute solution of either of the drugs is injected into a .vein it will produce great mental relaxation. In such a state of relaxa-tion, it is possible that a person might be more willing to answer awkward questions. This property of producing relaxation is an important effect of all the barbiturate drugs, and, in fact, it has now been found possible to use even the ultra-short acting barbiturates in this way. Psychiatric patients who have some particular irra-tional fear (such as claustrophobia), or who areparalysed with fright in certain situations, can be given dilute intravenous D injections of barbiturates. During the few minutes of the drug's action, the patient is encouraged to imagine himself indtehre-feared situation (e.g. riding on the u.n ground, or going in. a lift).

However, schizophrenia was not described until the late 1800s by Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926) and Eugen Bleuler (1857–1939). Kraeplin described the syndrome as a dementia praecox or decline in functioning with an early onset. The term ‘schizophrenia’ was first coined by Bleuler. The term itself is derived from two Greek words meaning ‘to split’ and ‘mind’ — a derivative that most likely contributes to the common misunderstanding that schizophrenia relates to split personality. Schizophrenia is not a split personality; it more closely resembles a split between a dream-state and reality. A person who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia will experience episodes of psychosis, including disturbances in perceptions and thinking. This in turn gives rise to unusual behaviour. There are a number of different types of schizophrenia; for example, paranoid, undifferentiated, catatonic and disorganised. Health professionals with an interest in this area are encouraged to seek out a specialist text on the different types of schizophrenia and what it is that differentiates them. Note that the term ‘schizophrenic’ is no longer used to describe a person who has schizophrenia due to the term’s pejorative connotations. Prevalence Schizophrenia is a disorder that typically develops in late adolescence or early adulthood. It affects both genders equally, but tends to be more severe and develop at an earlier age in males. Schizophrenia appears in about 0.3–0.7 per cent of the population of most countries, including Australia.\nPositive symptoms Health professionals are more likely to recognise the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. This is because they are most often overt and observable, unusual and extraordinary. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions and disorganised thinking. Hallucinations Hallucinations are usually described as false sensory perceptions, or perceptual phenomena arising without any external stimulus; for example, hearing (most common), seeing, smelling, feeling or tasting things that others do not. For people with a serious mental illness, the voices will often be persecutory and critical in nature, or may command the person to behave in a certain way. Hallucinations are described according to the sensory modality they affect and are referred to as follows.\n •\tAuditory — hearing things that are not there •\tVisual — seeing things that are not there. For example, ‘When I was unwell in hospital, I could see a young boy leaning over a small animal. I asked other people whether they could see it. They said no.’ •\tTactile — feeling things that are not there, such as feeling the presence of a parasite under the skin. •\tGustatory — tasting things that are not there. For example, ‘I started getting this weird taste in my mouth. It was salty. Then I worked out that it was sweat I was tasting. I couldn’t get away from the taste of sweat. I started drinking water, then I tried sweet drinks, but the taste of sweat would always come back. That lasted for about a week.’ •\tOlfactory — smelling things that are not there. For example, ‘Burning rubber was all I could smell. It stank! When I first started to smell it,  Delusions A delusion is a fixed and false belief that the person cannot be dissuaded from despite contradictory evidence. The belief is not based in the person’s cultural, religious/spiritual, educational or social experience and is maintained despite it not being shared by other members of the same culture. For example, believing that there is the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe would be in keeping with the beliefs of many other people in society, but believing that the health worker is an alien would not be in keeping with beliefs of others and so would be classified as a delusion.\nDelusions can also be bizarre or non-bizarre in nature. Bizarre delusions are beliefs that are implausible. For example, a person may believe that an alien has put a camera in their brain. Based upon scientific evidence, there is no likelihood that this has actually occurred. On the other hand, a non-bizarre delusion would involve a belief that on a balance of probability could possibly occur. For example, a person may believe that their manager is constantly checking up on them. Before writing off a belief as a delusion, health professionals are always wise to explore the person’s context, life experiences and the level of the belief. For example, is the person obsessed with the belief? How much is the belief driving their behaviour or consuming their lives? Answers to these questions are perhaps more significant to the care and treatment provided than the content of the delusions.\nDelusions may also be described in relation to their relationship with the person’s mood. For example, an individual whose mood is low may become utterly convinced that a particular person or group of people hates them. However, a delusion can also be mood neutral; for example, a person may believe that people with dark hair all follow a particular football team. More generally, delusions are classified according to theme. The most common of these themes are as follows.\n •\tPersecutory or paranoid delusions — a false belief that a person is the victim of a conspiracy. A person may believe they are being spied on, poisoned or about to be harmed in some way. •\tGrandiose delusions — a false belief that a person possesses special powers, talents or abilities. This may extend to a belief that they are royalty, a film star, an entrepreneur or millionaire, or a leader in their field. •\tSomatic delusions — a false belief that a person has an illness, which is not supported by medical evidence. Great care must be taken by health professionals to ensure that the symptoms being reported actually are delusional. People with a mental illness do become physically ill and some illnesses are difficult to diagnose. Just because a person has been diagnosed with a serious mental illness does not mean the symptoms the person reports are not real. •\tIdeas of references — a false belief that insignificant events have personal significance. This often displays itself in a person believing the television or radio has special messages for them. •\tReligious delusions — a false belief with religious or spiritual content. This can display as the person believing they are Jesus Christ or a special prophet who has come to save the world. As with hallucinations, when the person is relatively well, they may be able to recognise that these delusions are false personal beliefs. This level of insight helps the person to challenge their own thinking.  Disorganised thinking The types of disorganised thinking experienced by people with schizophrenia can vary. However, disorganised thinking is most often exhibited by the way the person speaks to the health professional. Disorganised thinking can lead to conversation that lacks structure and purpose or remains focused on the specific issue or idea that is causing distress for the person. Disorganised thinking is exhibited through speech and includes:\nNegative symptoms The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are generally less obvious than the positive symptoms. This is because the symptoms involve the withdrawal or retreat of the person from social contact. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are also more difficult to manage or treat; although the more recent atypical antipsychotic medications have been found to be helpful. atypical antipsychotic medications the newer generation of antipsychotic medications that treat psychosis\nUPON REFLECTION Schizophrenia’s negative symptoms The negative symptoms of schizophrenia include a lack of motivation and initiative, cognitive deficits and apathy. Questions\n How do these symptoms influence the provision of clinical treatment and the role that a health professional will need to take? What ethical and treatment considerations could arise for the health professional working with a patient from a diverse cultural background who is experiencing a religious delusion? How can health professionals engage with people experiencing negative symptoms to promote healthy and socially active lifestyle choices? Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are often very frustrating for the person who is experiencing them. They can also be quite distressing for partners, carers and family members. Examples of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are as follows.   •\tBlunted emotions. A person’s emotional responses are restricted, making them appear to be disinterested and withdrawn. •\tCognitive deficits. These impact upon the person’s ability to communicate; for example, the person may have difficulty in concentrating and be slow to react to sensory input. •\tApathy. The person has difficulty in undertaking straightforward tasks. They may appear slow and unmotivated. As already noted, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are less responsive to treatment than the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Even so, a range of treatment options is available for the symptoms of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medication may be prescribed and is usually continued on a long-term basis. A combination of pharmacological, social and psychological interventions, plus help and support to undertake specific activities of daily living, is the usual approach to treatment. The following ‘Big picture’ feature outlines one way that people with serious mental illness are provided with community support. Programs such as these have been rolled out across Australia and are demonstrating positive outcomes.

Different parents have their own vision, how it is possible and necessary to achieve what is needed from the child, the methods and techniques used depend on this vision in many respects. Unlike upbringing, which shapes the personality as a whole, management solves operational issues \u0026ldquo;here and now.\u0026rdquo;\nAny technology is based on some vision of the nature of the child and the tasks of the parent. In the case of a negative worldview of this vision is embodied in the model \u0026ldquo;Garden with weeds\u0026rdquo;, in the case of a positive - \u0026ldquo;Gardener and a rose.\u0026rdquo;\nGarden with weeds The \u0026ldquo;Garden with weeds\u0026rdquo; model is based on the belief that a child needs to be treated like a neglected garden, to find and weed out weed deficiencies in his soul. Parents struggle with laziness and disorganization of children, trample on children's aggressiveness and burn baby lies with a hot iron. The usual result: the contact is destroyed, the efficiency is low, little is achieved. Sukhomlinsky said that in this case, education is \u0026ldquo;on the wrong track.\u0026rdquo; “Vices,” he wrote, “are eradicated by themselves, go unnoticed by the child, and their destruction is not accompanied by any painful phenomena if they are replaced by a stormy growth of virtues.” The model is controversial, working more positively, see → .\nGardener and rose\nIn this model, the child is seen as a beautiful flower, which the caregiver and gardener should take care of. A good gardener must understand the nature of a flower, bush or fruit tree in order to grow in it what is laid in it by its nature ↑ . Here in the child, parents try to discern what the child’s inclinations are and support him in his aspirations and endeavors. With this approach, the educational results are better than in the \u0026ldquo;Garden with Weeds\u0026rdquo; model, but the metaphor of the seed from which the child’s personality unfolds is controversial .\nImpact target Some of the parents think it is right to turn to feelings more often, some to the mind, someone to solve problems by training that works at the body level.\nTraining, or carrot and stick model\nIt seems to be the most natural: to reward for a good deed, for a bad deed - to punish, scold. In principle, this is reasonable, but there are also disadvantages: this system requires the constant presence of an educator, a “stick” destroys the contact between a child and an educator, and a “carrot” teaches a child not to do good without an award \u0026hellip;\nOptions: Bribery. \u0026ldquo;If you're good, I'll buy you ice cream.\u0026rdquo; In skillful hands, he goes over to the Reward for Success model. More often ends with a pedagogical situation. Little tyrant: “If you do not buy me ice cream, I will behave badly!”\nAnother option: a short leash - a positive training, practicing unconditional obedience. A lot of interesting tasks, simple instructions and immediately - a positive reinforcement .\nThe carrot and stick model is controversial if it turns out to be not the main but the main one. The matter of education is better if the method of rewards and punishments is supplemented by the method of negative and positive reinforcements, and preference is given to positive reinforcements and reinforcements not so much of desirable external actions as of desirable internal states and relationships. In any case, it is useful to remember that real education goes far beyond the best training ↑ .\nAppeal to the senses Appeal to feelings is more often a female strategy. The standard options are appeal to empathy (“See how your sister cries because of you!” Or “Please don’t anger your mom”), distraction from unwanted things (“Look what a bird!) And attraction to the desired, as well as decision making based on the feelings that the child demonstrates to parents (Traffic Light model).\nLook, sister is crying from you!\nTo the great surprise of adults, and especially mothers, this treatment usually does not affect young children at all. However, if children are angry for a long time in such situations, sooner or later they will understand what adults want from them, and begin to portray remorse. However, children like to copy adults, and if mother is often upset, children begin to repeat after her. It is hard to call it genuine empathy, but the road to it is paving. Real empathy arises in children no earlier than seven years of age, and here everything is very individual. If the children are very disposed towards this, but there are no dispositions towards this.\nPlease don’t angry mom!\nWhen the child does not obey, the mother begins to upset herself and show how bad she is from this behavior of the child. This model is very common, and is usually practiced among women. Her results? In young children, especially in girls, guilt , attachment and obedience are successfully formed . Older children, and especially boys, are worse off, they get irritated or do not care about their mother’s feelings.\nLook what a bird!\nThe child is looking for more and more attractive things around him, distracting from the unnecessary. Doesn’t eat porridge - we’ll offer an apple. She doesn’t want to do morning exercises, we suggest we go swimming with friends. Swimming didn’t go - we’ll try to interest a beautiful game of tennis. Works well with young children. The older the children, the more often failures occur. As a rule, this path ends with the Bribery model.\nIn this model, parents in their actions are guided by the feelings and reactions of the child. Feelings and reactions of the child are the colors of the traffic light for the parent. When a child responds positively to the actions of parents, enjoys the actions of parents, this is a green light for them, a signal to parents: \u0026ldquo;Go ahead! You are doing everything right.\u0026rdquo; If the child fulfills the parents\u0026rsquo; requests reluctantly, forgets, snarls - this is the yellow color for the parents, the warning color: \u0026ldquo;Attention, be careful, something seems wrong! Think before you say or do it!\u0026quot;. If the child is in protest, this is the red color for the parents, the signal is: “Stop !!! Freeze! In this direction, not a step forward! Remember where and what you violated, urgently and environmentally correct!”\nThe controversial model. The advantages of this model are sensitivity to feedback, the disadvantages are that it is easy to fall under the influence of a child. The child begins to control the parents, showing them their reactions \u0026hellip;\nAppeal to the mind\nTraffic rules. This model assumes that the child is behaving badly because he simply does not know or has forgotten the rules. And if you tell him the rules and he learns them, then he will do everything \u0026hellip; And the parent explains everything, teaches, tells. Children can listen to this sadly, but - they have to \u0026hellip; Of course, knowledge of how to behave is necessary, but knowledge alone without interest and training is dead. It’s easy to make sure that children know all the main rules of behavior: “Fighting is bad,” “Lying badly,” “Things must be put in place,” but in a clash of reason and feelings, feelings more often prevail in children, especially if the child does not understand the meaning of the rule: “ Why do you need to put things in some place, if they are already so good? \u0026quot; Children need to be taught the rules, the rules should be simple and understandable,↑ \u0026hellip; Total, if the model \u0026ldquo;Rules of the movement\u0026rdquo; is not auxiliary, but the main one, then this is a controversial model.\nMethods and techniques for managing a child Methods and techniques for managing a child are highly dependent on the child's controllability, the views and motivation of the parents, and the requirements of a particular situation. In free education, the method of well-directed freedom is more often used, in disciplinary - instructions and a reinforcement system.\nAuthor: N.I. Kozlov (Russian) N.I.

Do not retire. “Experience shows that when a person who suddenly stops working, obesity and chronic diseases begin to develop,” says Luigi Ferrucci, director of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. In Chianti (Italy), which is famous for its centenarians, there is a wide variety of ways for leisure. “After leaving their jobs, the Italians spend most of their time on small farms, cultivating wine and vegetables,” says Luigi Ferrucci. “They never are passive.” Is farming not for you? Settle in the museum! Yes and in general - mass options, even if you will work for little money or even for free.\n2. Use floss every day. This can help keep your arteries healthy. In 2008, a study was tested at the University of New York (New York University), which found that daily use of dental floss reduces the number of pathogenic bacteria in the mouth. These bacteria can enter the blood circulation and cause various inflammatory lesions in the arteries, which is the main risk factor for heart diseases. “I believe that people should use the floss twice a day to get the expected effect,” says Dr. Perls.\n3. Get moving! “Physical activity is the only real source of your youth that exists,” said Jay Olshansky, a professor of medicine, an aging researcher at the University of Illinois, Chicago. “It looks like gasoline and engine oil for your car. You should not do this, but your car will definitely drive better. ” According to numerous studies thanks to exercise, mood, mental acuity, muscle mass and bone are improved.\n“The benefits come immediately after your first training session,” adds Olshanski. Do not worry if you do not have a subscription to the fitness center (or you don’t have enough money to buy it). Walk to friends (on foot, of course) or go to a local park. A half day of walks will be enough for a start. If you don’t want to build muscle with the help of trainers, try yoga - you don’t need to lift it.\n4. Eat fiber-rich cereals on breakfast. Consuming whole grains, especially for breakfast, helps keep sugar levels stable throughout the day.\n5. Sleep at least six hours a day. By adding the missing sleep hours, you will add a few years to your life. “Sleep is one of the most important functions that our body uses to regulate and restore cells,” says Dr. Ferrucci. “We calculated that the minimum amount of sleep that a person needs to get the fast eye movement phase (REM phase) is about six hours.”\n6. Eat whole grains, without additives. People whose blood has a high level of certain nutrients - selenium, beta-carotene, vitamin C and E, as a rule live longer and have better cognitive indicators. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that taking medications with these trace elements and vitamins will have a similar effect. There are more than 200 different carotenoids and 200 different flavonoids in a single tomato, \u0026ldquo;says Ferrucci. There are fewer white foods - bread, flour, sugar and more colored vegetables and fruits, and dark whole grain breads and cereals.\n7. Do not be nervous. According to a new study, centenarians usually do not take problems to heart and live with troubles. In short, they simply do not steam. If this is an innate trait, find a way for yourself that allows you to manage your stress: yoga, exercise, meditation, tai chi, and give deep breathing in the end! -Watch, chips in front of the TV, booze? No, this is a very bad option.\n8. Live as Seventh Day Adventists. Americans who consider themselves Seventh-day Adventists have an average life span of 89 years. Almost 10 years more than the average American lives. One of the main principles of this religion is to take care of your body. This means not to smoke, not to abuse alcohol and sweet. Followers of this religion usually follow a veggie diet based on fruits and vegetables, beans and nuts, and they are also active in physical exercise. And also they pay great attention to the family and society.\n9. Habits. Long-livers usually have a strict order, says Dr. Olshanski. - They adhere to a certain diet and engage in certain physical activities throughout life. They wake up and go to bed at the same time. This is another good habit that keeps your body in equilibrium. “Your physiology becomes fragile as you age,” says Ferrucci. - \u0026ldquo;And the more difficult it is for your body to bounce back if you, say, miss a few hours of sleep or drink a lot of alcohol.\u0026rdquo; This can weaken the immune system, making you more susceptible to viral infections.\n10. Contact. Regular contact with your friends and family is the key to avoiding depression, which can lead to early death. Some psychologists believe that the main benefit for older people from physical exercise is social interaction.\nAuthor: N.I. Kozlov (Russian) N.I.

At this stage, the client will tell a lot of different things, mixing everything together. The consultant must carefully choose which lines to respond to and which ones to skip. Which questions are answered in detail, and which are concise. Each phrase of the consultant should be thought out - how will the client react? Skip ears? Thinking about it? Will go into unnecessary emotions? Superfluous words, superfluous reactions lower the status of a consultant.\n  The second task of this stage is to rebuild the client from longing and negativity. What are some ways to do this?\n   Talk about feelings and about everything internal to translate into conversations about behavior. “How do you behave, what do you do when you are in such a mood?” There may be a conversation about internal behavior - internal decisions of a person or his way of thinking. “Why do you think so? Don’t think so anymore! Think like that! ” Suggest something to eat (e.g. sweets for tea). The chewing process is not compatible with hysteria. Talk about something clever, where you need to think, directly or indirectly related to the topic of the client (to calculate some numbers: money, time, amount of resources, etc., to build the logic of actions: first this, then that, etc. P.) Relax the client by talking about pleasant things or NLP techniques. Rebuild the client with their intonations - business, positive, friendly. Talk about how you, as a consultant, deal with negative emotions, how to get out of them. During the consultation, share with the client what is happening with me. Demonstrate to the client how I deal with this condition. The client understands - since the consultant can talk about this, then I can. Here's how it turns out you can handle it - you can talk about it.   The third objective of this stage is to involve the client in the work . To do this, you can:  Diligent client - you need to help transfer the request from the problem to the conscious, and then to the developing one.\nTo a stupid client - the consultant selects the request himself, translating it into the client’s delirium so that the task is clear and close to the client. Moreover, the consultant has no task to dissuade, open his eyes to the truth, etc. On occasion, you can talk about some research or refer to the relevant articles, showing your competence.\nThe next stage of the consultation is\nSearch for a solution  Turn to your own experience and practice. Consider personal relationships from a position of business interaction, and business relationships from a personal perspective. Use the Synton card for personal diagnosis. Do not rush to engage in subtle and deep psychology, when you can change the everyday alignment of forces. “Girl, surround yourself with guys, choose from many, and then this one will agree for everything for you!” Forming your concept is a mechanism that explains what happens in a client’s life. Offering a solution to a client, the consultant does not insist, but “sells”, at the end specifying: “Will this recommendation suit you?”  The task of involving the client in the work at this stage is also very important. How can a consultant help a client get involved?\n Pretend to be dull, force the client to explain the details. Play roles. If the client perceives the consultant as a Strict father or a Custodial mother, it may be difficult for him to think independently. Moving to the position of Business partner or Sincere friend, the consultant can significantly affect the activity of the client. Intervention - change your behavior and watch how the client’s behavior changes. When a client comes with his request, he is a master in this request, he has been doing this all his life. Our task is to see where he will drag us into his game. To draw the attention of the client to his behavior here and now, during the consultation, to find analogies with his behavior in life. Everything that the client does in life, he does in consultation. The tool of the consultant is to show the client that his patterns of behavior and communication in life are manifested at the current moment, during the consultation in communication with the consultant.  Customer service We distinguish two main tasks of this stage - creating a resource state for a client, and resolving client difficulties using techniques and methods that a consultant owns.\nWhat methods do we have for solving these two problems?\n Drawing up a clear action plan, ORA. Desensitization and all NLP techniques. Testing behavior, intonation, facial expressions. Coaching techniques for setting goals, choosing paths, etc.  The final stage The final stage gives the consultation a logical and emotional completeness. It involves three tasks:\nCreating customer intentions. The questions “What will you do?” Or “How will you now think / relate to the situation?” Help the client formulate his intention. Speaking their intentions out loud, the client increases the chances that the intentions will be realized. If after that you talk to the client about the nuances (how exactly he will do what he is going to do, when exactly he will do it, in which place, under what circumstances, etc.) and ask the client to send a progress report - then the chances of fulfilling the intention will increase . At the next consultation, you must definitely ask the client about the fulfillment of his intention. Joint analysis of the results will help move forward more efficiently. Of course, that punishing the client for failure to fulfill obligations is inappropriate. But it is possible to arrange an additional conversation from this. “Well, you did not send me an SMS, but what did you do to not send an SMS, and how does it happen in your life? How did you manage to not send me sms for 2 whole nights in a row? How many times a day did you recall this? Probably remembered in the evening? With each memory, did you have some kind of inner decision or resistance, or something else? You seemed to be going to \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\nMaintaining respect and status. The first mistake of beginning consultants is when the main work is done, relax and leave the role of a consultant, crumple the end of the session. The second mistake is the desire to ask the client for feedback on their work. Instead, you need to ask the question: “What do you take for yourself from today's consultation?” Thus, the client does not evaluate the consultant, but his thoughts. Involvement in self-development. A competent consultant at the end of the consultation will definitely make a broach for the next meeting - he will show the client what else he should work on in the future. These marginal notes came to me thanks to the Consulting Laboratory. I would be glad if they would be useful to other students.\nconducted by N.I.

Sociopsychological aspects, including the lack or overload of neurotransmitters in the brain's neural circuits, which are typically responsible for emotional parts such as anxiety and depression, genetic or natural predisposition, and functional or structural changes in the brain as revealed in brain imaging studies. For example, pathological anxiety can be caused by past experiences and the cognitive behavioral aspects of interpreting and judging current accepted information.\nSymptom Symptoms of anxiety disorder vary with each diagnosis. Typical symptoms are as follows.\n  Panic disorder : Suddenly severe fear or discomfort peaks in minutes, while physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, tightness of the chest, increased heart rate, sweating, and severe anxiety and fear of dying . There is a fear of panic attacks coming back, so avoid places or situations that you think are related to them and often avoid activities that resemble panic symptoms, such as running, climbing stairs, and arguing.\n  Agoraphobia : Extreme fear and anxiety in situations such as using public transportation, being in an open space such as a park, being in an enclosed space such as a movie theater, being in a line or in a crowd, or being alone outside the house. In this case, the condition of avoiding such situation lasts more than six months. In general, it is often closely related to panic disorder.\n  Anxiety disorder: Excessive anxiety and anxiety about minor and everyday tasks lasts for a long time and is often difficult to control and is often accompanied by various physical symptoms associated with anxiety (insomnia, increased muscle tone, etc.).\n  Social Anxiety Disorders : Characteristic symptoms experience significant fear and anxiety in social situations that can be closely monitored or negatively assessed, leading to the avoidance of such social situations.\n  specific phobia: Excessive fear of a particular object or situation causes almost no excessive fear, such as crying, sitting down or losing consciousness when contacted with high places, snakes, insects, blood, syringe needles, etc. Panic attacks often occur.\n  Anxiety Disorder: The most common anxiety disorder in children under 12 years of age. When the subject forming the main attachment is located next to them, they feel relieved. Frequent fears of unhappy things can happen to them and their parents, and they often show concern by complaining of physical symptoms such as abdominal pain, headache, nausea and vomiting.\n  Selective narcolepsy: I don't have a problem talking to close people like my parents or siblings, but I don't speak with strangers or in certain situations.\n  Diagnosis / Test Anxiety disorders are diagnosed through consultation with mental health physicians, medical history listening and Q \u0026amp; A. If necessary, a symptom assessment questionnaire can assess the severity of the disease.\nTests such as blood tests or brain imaging ( such as magnetic resonance imaging ) are performed to differentiate between other neurological and medical conditions that may cause anxiety .\ncure After the diagnosis process, the treatment may vary depending on the detailed diagnosis of the anxiety disorder, but drug treatment using antidepressants and anti-anxiety agents is most often used. Antianxiety medications are used to immediately relieve anxiety symptoms, and antidepressants take more than two weeks to take effect. Cognitive behavioral therapy can be used as a non-drug therapy in panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, specific phobia and social phobia among anxiety disorders . It is a combination of behavioral therapy that corrects cognitive errors, exposes patients to anxiety-causing factors, and then controls their anxiety symptoms and behaviors.\nDepending on the diagnosis, the appropriate treatment technique will be applied and practiced for 8 to 16 different time periods. Other psychoanalytic therapies deal with the unconscious part of the mind associated with anxiety. Each treatment is optionally prescribed according to the patient's condition after an accurate diagnosis by the psychiatrist.\nProgress / Complications Appropriate treatment can reduce anxiety and recover, but in many cases relapses can occur and become chronic. Anxiety disorders are often accompanied by mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder, and when alcohol is frequently used to reduce anxiety, addictive diseases such as alcohol dependence may occur.\nPrevention method Anxiety disorders are caused by a variety of causes, most of which are difficult to prevent. However, it is necessary to control and manage stress through relaxation such as relaxation, hobbies and deep breathing.\nDiet / Life Guide You need an attitude that understands and supports the anxious patient. And it is not a good idea to inadvertently expose the patient to anxiety-causing factors.

Onset is usually before the age of 30 years, but can occur at any time. The most common pattern involves repeated episodes of mania or depression, usually followed by a period of remission. Genetics are thought to be largely responsible for determining an individual’s likelihood of developing a bipolar disorder. In families where one person has bipolar disorder, there are often other family members who have experienced episodes of depressive illness or hypomania.\nMania People who experience a mania often have disjointed or distorted thinking. Hallucinations and delusions are also common and often appear very real to the person. People can also experience ‘mystical experiences’ where they see special connections between events or other experiences. During an episode of mania, the person is at risk of behaving in an antisocial way (which may be out of character for them) and this may lead to serious financial, legal and relationship problems. The person may neglect their personal hygiene and physical health, and other symptoms of mental illness may also be present.\nThis often leads to the person being hospitalised. mania an episode of highly elevated mood which interferes significantly in day-to-day life grandiosity overvalued sense of self — often related to elevated mood state in bipolar disorder\nHypomania is similar to mania; however, the symptoms are less severe and cause less impairment for the individual. Usually no psychotic features are evident in a hypomanic episode and the person may not require hospitalisation (APA, 2013). In addition to mania and/or hypomania, the person with a bipolar disorder will typically experience episodes of depression. The frequency or lengths of the cycles between mania and depression will depend upon the person’s individual experience. However, mood stabilising medication will often give rise to longer periods between the highs and the lows, as well as decreasing the extremes of the highs and lows.\nMental Health Care An Introduction for Health Professionals in Australia Hungerford | Hodgson | Clancy | Monisse-Redman | Bostwick | Jones Youtube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/resource/health/bipolar_disorder/","tags":["health"],"title":"How to treat A ‘manic depression’.

When they are small, they pass out of our bodies through urine, but when they are large, many stones in the urinary system, such as the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, Can cause problems.\nKidney stones can irritate and injure surrounding tissues and cause very severe hematuria. If large enough to block the flow of urine, urine does not drain from one kidney, resulting in swelling and severe pain in the side. It also reduces the function of the kidneys. In addition, as the stones pass, they can easily cause infections of the urinary system, causing symptoms of urinary tract infections such as fever and cloudy urine.\nPain from kidney stones can occur suddenly and cause extreme pain, which can frighten many people, but in most cases, life-threatening problems can be resolved on their own or resolved with simple treatment. Almost no\nIf kidney stones recur frequently, it is necessary to identify the risk factors that cause them for some reason. In other words, if the concentration of certain substances rises or is insufficient, kidney stones may occur, so if the patient's stones come out in the urine, it is necessary to analyze what components are present. This analysis is very important because it allows for accurate prevention. Even if the exact cause is not known, drinking enough water and adjusting your diet can reduce the frequency of occurrence.\nCauses and Risks 1. The process of development of kidney stones The kidneys are two bean-sized fist-sized organs, one on each side of the lower back spine. The main function of the kidneys is to mix and discharge water, various electrolytes and metallic minerals, toxins, etc. from our bodies into the urine.\nIn most cases, kidney stones are not a single factor, but a combination of factors.\nKidney stones occur when the balance of these various components in the urine is broken. Kidney stones can also occur if urine is low and there are ingredients in the urine that can make crystals of various substances. Kidney stones can also occur if your urine is overly acidic or alkaline, and can also occur when your body does not properly absorb the special components in your urine.\nThere are many substances that make up kidney stones. Kidney stones are easily formed when the concentration of calcium, oxalate , and uric acid increases in the urine, depending on the infection, food, drug, or body condition . The composition of the stones depends on these factors, and the most common kidney stones are kidney stones that contain calcium. Knowing the components of kidney stones can also help determine the cause of kidney stones.\n2. Types of Kidney Stones According to Ingredients Analyzing kidney stones released by the body reveals the composition of the stones. Kidney stones are classified according to their composition as follows.\n calcium stones  80% of kidney stones are made up of calcium, which is chemically calcium oxalate . Fish is present in some fruits and vegetables, but most of the fish in our bodies comes from metabolism in the liver. Certain foods, high intakes of vitamin D, surgery in some intestines, and various metabolic disorders increase calcium and oxalate levels in the urine, forming calcium stones.\nstruvite ( Struvite ) absent  These stones are common in women, and most are caused by a urinary tract infection. These stones can grow large enough to fill the space where urine collects on one kidney, and in this case, they can be shaped like antlers along the shape of a python.\nuric acid stones  This stone is formed by uric acid and is a byproduct of protein metabolism in our bodies. If you continue to eat high protein, you may have uric acid stones. It can also occur in patients with gout, and if there are genetic factors or metabolic disorders, it can be caused by uric acid in the urine as the uric acid in the blood increases.\ncystine stones  A relatively rare type of kidney stone that occurs in people with a condition in which a specific amino acid (cystine) is genetically released through the kidneys.\nRisk Factors for Kidney Stones  The following factors are known to increase the risk of kidney stones.  lack of moisture  If you don't drink enough water, your urine will concentrate, resulting in an increase in the concentration of many substances that can make kidney stones, which can lead to kidney stones. Especially if you sweat a lot during the hot season and lose a lot of water, kidney stones may occur if you do not replenish the water properly.\nfamily or individual medical history  If someone in your family has or has had kidney stones, they are more likely to have kidney stones than people who do not have them. And people who have had a history of kidney stones are more likely to have stones again than people who do not.\nage and gender  Most kidney stones occur between the ages of 20 and 70, and men are more prone to kidney stones than women.\nDietary  Protein-rich, salty and low-calcium foods increase the likelihood of kidney stones.\nlack of exercise  Kidney stones can easily occur if you live in bed or just sit in a chair at work. This lack of exercise can lead to the release of calcium from the bones, causing them to accumulate in the kidneys, leading to partial kidney stones.\nobesity  People with high body mass index, high waist circumference, and being overweight have a high frequency of kidney stones in the long run. This is more pronounced for women.\nhigh blood pressure  The incidence of kidney stones in people with high blood pressure is about twice that of people with normal blood pressure.\nPeople who have undergone gastric bypass surgery, patients with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea  Gastric bypass surgery is a person who has a stomach and small intestine directly connected to the stomach, such as a stomach ulcer or cancer. People who have these surgeries, those with inflammatory bowel disease, and those with chronic diarrhea can change kidney absorption by changing the absorption of calcium in food and increasing the concentration of substances in the stones.\nSymptoms and Complications  Symptoms of Kidney Stones  Symptoms associated with kidney stones can vary depending on the size of the stone, the location of the stone, and the presence of an infection.\nCommon symptoms of kidney stones include:  Pain in the back or side: A sudden, very severe pain that many people feel is one of the worst pains in their life. The pain may worsen and then improve and may last for 20 to 60 minutes once occurring. hematuria: Some people see urine that contains clear blood that can be clearly seen by their eyes, but a small amount of blood that is invisible to the eye and can be seen under a microscope is mixed with urine. Urinary tract: A smell or turbid color of urine comes out of the eye. Nausea and vomiting: Can occur if kidney stones affect the digestive system. Fever and chills: May occur when inflammation is caused by kidney stones. Frequent urination : Frequent urination symptoms. Urination : It is difficult to hold urine as soon as urine comes out. dysuria: The symptoms are pain when you urinate occurs.  Although one or more of these symptoms may appear, a combination of symptoms usually occurs. On the other hand, some patients rarely feel any symptoms, and they may find kidney stones by accident during a physical exam or other tests to diagnose other illnesses.\nComplications of Kidney Stones  If kidney stones remain in one kidney, they grow very large or cause infection. However, they may not cause any other symptoms or complications unless they block the flow of urine.\nIf a stone is caught in any of the urine's pathways and blocks the flow of urine, stagnant urine can cause increased pressure, which can cause pain, damage the kidneys, and cause bleeding and infection.\nDiagnosis In general, the diagnosis of kidney stones may require the following tests:\n1. Listen to troops To identify risk factors for kidney stones. Severe, sudden onset of age, sex, eating habits, drinking water frequently, whether you have kidney stones in your family, whether you have had kidney stones before, and whether the pain you complain is in your lower back or side Check for pain.\n2. Physical examination Identify the area that complains of pain, especially if you are knocking on one side of your lower back.\n3. Blood test Your blood may be checked for high concentrations of substances that cause kidney stones, such as uric acid, and if necessary, special tests may be done to check your minerals and amino acids. You can also check whether kidney failure is caused by kidney stones and whether white blood cells are elevated due to inflammation.\n4. Urine test Check the color and smell of the urine, and make sure that red blood cells, which should not normally be present under the microscope, are not mixed with urine, even if the visible blood is not mixed.\n5. Imaging Medical Examination Test Test Test  abdominal radiography  X-rays of the abdomen can reveal stones in most kidneys and reveal the location and size of kidney stones. However, stones that are made up of some specific components (uric acid) may transmit radiation and may not be detected by radiography.\nKidney stones found on abdominal radiography 2) abdominal ultrasound\nRadiofrequency examinations have the advantages of no pain, no safety, and no exposure to radiation. However, it is easy to miss small stones in the ureters or bladder.\nAbdominal computed tomography ( CT )  This test is very helpful in finding kidney stones in the acute phase and urinary stones. Even small stones can be found, and the location and size of all stones above a certain size can be determined by the resolution of the shooting machine, regardless of the composition.\nCT Findings of Kidney Stones 3) Urinary Angiography\nThis test involves taking a drug called a contrast agent, which can appear white on a radiograph through a vein, and then the radiation is filtered through the kidneys and passed through the ureter, bladder, and urinary tract. Urinary angiography is a very useful test to determine the location of kidney stones, and if the stones block the flow of urine, it can help to determine the urinary system. Recently, computed tomography ( CT ) replaces this test in many cases.\nUrinary tract imaging Precautions when Performing Urinary Imaging\nContrast agent is an iodine injection containing iodine, which does not easily pass through x- rays. The contrast agent is then excreted along the ureter through the kidneys, resulting in empty spaces on the X- ray image of stones present inside the ureter.\nContrast agents, on the other hand, can be used to more clearly distinguish abnormal areas in organs, such as cancer, in tests such as CT .\nHowever, contrast agents may rarely cause side effects, especially in people with allergies, asthma and severe illnesses such as heart disease, and those with past drug side effects. In most cases, the side effects of injections of the contrast agent are mild, including nausea, hives, itching, spots or redness of the face, coughing, hoarseness, runny nose, and shortness of breath.\nHowever, just as rarely as a bee-killed person dies from a severe allergic reaction, one in every 30,000 or 100,000 people who have received a contrast agent has reported a very serious form of allergic reaction.\nIn order to prevent such risks, prior to conducting a test that injects contrast agents, the patient's past history is to determine whether there is a history of contrast agent side effects or risk factors for contrast agent side effects.\ncure  Early Pain Treatment  In many cases, small kidney stones (typically less than 5 mm ) are excreted in the urine by themselves, so there is often no treatment other than pain control. However, pain from urinary tract stones is so severe and intense that an appropriate analgesic agent is needed, and sometimes an antispasmodic medication that relaxes the urinary tract contractions.\nTreatment to excrete in urine  For small stones, infusion of fluid or drinking plenty of water may help to induce natural excretion into the urine.\nExtracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotomy ( ESWL )  This procedure is a common method for kidney or urinary stones.\nExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy can be used in stones where natural discharge is considered difficult, especially stones of some size. In this method, before the procedure, the location of the stones is determined by the imaging method. Then, an ultrasonic shock wave is applied to the stones to break the stones into small pieces and then discharge them naturally.\nExtracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy This procedure may be done after a simple anesthesia, and it may sound quite loud when a shock wave is applied, but it is rarely dangerous for the patient.\nComplications from this procedure can be temporary bloody urine and temporary bleeding of the kidneys or surrounding tissue. Also, if the stones are not completely crushed, it may be necessary to repeat the procedure several times or remove the remaining stones by urinary endoscopic examination.\nAfter the procedure, stones may be excreted over a few weeks, depending on the patient.\nIf extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is not successful or the size of the stone is large, urological surgery is used to make a small incision in the patient's back and remove the stone using a device called a nephroscope.\nPercutaneous Stone Removal 5. Stone removal using ureteroscope\nThis procedure is a method to remove stones that do not drain from the ureters. Use a small endoscope to enter the bladder, then remove the stone by using an instrument mounted on the endoscope. In recent years, the endoscope can be equipped with ultrasound or a laser to break up and remove some stones.\nStone Removal Using Urinary Endoscopy 6. Medical Medication\nIf the substance that makes up the stone can be dissolved by the drug, you can try to dissolve the stone by dispensing the appropriate drug and drain it into the urine.\nprevention To prevent the development of kidney stones, lifestyle modifications and medications can be taken to prevent the formation of stones.\n Lifestyle correction   much water intake  Drinking lots of fluids, and therefore urinating too much, prevents the formation of stones and makes them easier to urinate. To do this, it is recommended that you drink at least 2 to 3 liters of water and at least 2 liters of urine a day. However, if it is difficult to measure the correct amount, it is better to drink enough water to urinate so that the color is almost colorless when you urinate. This is because thick urine means that you have not consumed enough fluid in concentrated urine.\nGood drinks to prevent kidney stones  Water is best for rehydration. Other than that, it is best to drink a glass of lemonade (although this is not a common drink in our country). If lemonade is difficult to obtain, lemon juice or orange juice has a similar effect. Drinking these juices is known to increase citrate in our body, which is known to prevent the formation of stones.\nAvoiding Foods That Cause Kidney Stones  The most common foods that cause calcium stones are oxalic acid-rich foods that combine with calcium to form stones. Avoid these foods as much as possible to avoid kidney stones. These foods include rhubarb, kale, beans, spinach, sweet potatoes, almonds, and sesame seeds. These foods are generally known to be good for health, and they are supplied in the form of green juice. If you have a family member with kidney stones or have had kidney stones, you should consider them well.\nIncrease your calcium intake  In fact, eating a lot of calcium-rich food does not mean you have more calcium stones. Conversely, eating calcium-rich foods helps prevent kidney stones because this calcium is excreted in the stool in combination with the fishery that makes stones in your intestines. Therefore, calcium intake should be actively recommended to prevent kidney stones. The exception is that too much calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract can cause kidney stones, so avoid excessive intake.\nPrevention using drugs  When the kidney stones are analyzed and the components of the stones are identified, they can be prescribed to prevent the recurrence. For example, to prevent calcium stones, you can try to prevent them by choosing one of the diuretics. The choice of such drugs requires the judgment of a specialist.\nYoutube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/resource/health/kidney_stones/","tags":["health"],"title":"Kidney stones How to Diagnose Kidney stones and Get Rid of Kidney stones "},{"categories":["Health"],"contents":"Meditation Related concepts: visualization , autogenic training .

Great meditation!\nUse of meditation Meditation is definitely good for mental and physical health . If you remove the high words and aspirations, then the real mechanism of meditation is simple and has long been known to science: it is desensitization. Back in the early twentieth century, researchers discovered that fears and memories of traumatic situations are easily and effectively removed if the image that worries us is viewed by us against the background of complete bodily relaxation. Actually, if any image or thought becomes anchored in muscle tension, we will get an image that strains us and thoughts that are difficult for us. If, on the contrary, we scroll through problematic thoughts and hard memories against a background of a relaxed body (plus combine with a bright inner background and soft relaxing music), then the tension and heaviness will quickly disappear. And the soul will be - easy!\nThere is nothing new here that goes beyond the limits of the work of combining reflexes according to Bekhterev - no. Today, all NLP practitioners and almost all psychotherapists use this, not always understanding the real mechanism of the useful procedures that they use.\nMeditations are fashionable and sell well, especially when you are promised a “state of complete awareness” along with health benefits. Here, please be careful: a \u0026ldquo;state of full awareness\u0026rdquo; is often promised, but in real practice it is more often absent, giving way, on the contrary, to a state of uncritical suggestibility.\nIs this good or bad? It depends. If the client does not listen to anyone and suffers from it himself, then any specialist psychotherapist, in order not to suffer from his resistance, will offer him, under one pretext or another, to relax, close his eyes, after which he will most likely arrange a very useful “spiritual journey”, as a result of which the client seems to get to everything that the psychotherapist has easily instilled in him. And really helped. Could this be harmful or dangerous? Theoretically - yes, almost more often it is very useful. A fraudster will deprive you of money without any meditation, problematic suggestions from watching television broadcasts significantly block any possible harm from meditation \u0026hellip; Everything is determined by those who meditate with you.

Antibiotic medicinal drugs are broadly used inside the remedy and prevention of such infections.They can also both kill or inhibit the growth of micro organism. A restricted range of antibiotics additionally possess antiprotozoal activity. Antibiotics are not powerful toward viruses consisting of the not unusual bloodless or influenza; drugs which inhibit viruses are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals instead of antibiotics.\nSometimes, the time period antibiotic which means \u0026ldquo;opposing life\u0026rdquo;, based mostly on Greek roots, (ἀντι-) anti: \u0026ldquo;closer to\u0026rdquo; and (βίος-) biotic: \u0026ldquo;life\u0026rdquo;, is broadly used to consult any substance used in competition to microbes, but inside the common medical usage, antibiotics (together with penicillin) are the ones produced naturally (by means of one microorganism fighting another), whereas nonantibiotic antibacterials (such as sulfonamides and antiseptics) are clearly synthetic.

The busy lifestyle of many Americans often leads to poor eating habits. It is a lot easier to go through the drive through and get a bag full of cheeseburgers and French fries than it is to stop at the grocery store a buy healthy, nutritious food that you will have to go home and prepare and then have to dirty kitchen to clean up. One could argue that it is cheaper to eat fast food than it is to eat a vegetarian diet, but the cost of poor heath is much higher. In a 2008 report published by Mayo Clinic Health Solutions, they state that obesity related claims accounted for 2.8% of health care costs. This might not seem like much, bit 2.8% of the $2 trillion that the U.S. spends on health care is a lot of money.

A strict vegan is at a slight risk of being deficient in n-3 polyunsaturated fats, vitamin D, iron, vitamin B-12, and zinc. The risk of these deficiencies is not significant in partial vegetarians that consume fish, eggs, and sea vegetables (2009).

Foreword The ketogenic diet is one of the most popular diets in the near future. 70% of people use it to lose weight and 30% of them take care of their health. Most people will fall in love with this diet after using it, but 90% of people in the fitness industry will object to a ketogenic diet Is a ketogenic diet really such an effective weight loss diet ? Is ketogenic really so bad for bodybuilders? I need you to put down all your prejudice against ketogenic diet, and keep a neutral perspective on this ketogenic diet article. I will honestly use research papers and personal experience to analyze the good and bad of ketogenic diet.\nIntroducing the ketogenic diet People often ask me how to eat a ketogenic diet, then we can first see the picture below Half of the plates in the ketogenic diet are lean meat or eggs, and then half are vegetables, which probably looks like this. (This meat looks thin, but I use a lot of oil to cook it)\nKetogenic diet You may see on the Internet that the ketogenic diet is the right amount of protein , good enough fat, and low enough sugars, such as 70% fat, 25% protein, 5% sugars and the like. But this will be explained in more detail in the next article, \u0026ldquo;How to eat a ketogenic diet\u0026rdquo;. Ketogenic mean, so that the body can produce \u0026ldquo;life\u0026rdquo; , more \u0026quot; one\u0026rdquo; body diet in order to stay stable nutritional ketosis (Nutritional Ketosis) as the goal. So why do you produce ketone bodies? Because ketone bodies are metabolites after burning fat when the body's sugar (Note 1) content is low enough, a high blood ketone concentration is equivalent to knowing that fat is now being burned as energy. In order for the body to produce enough ketone bodies and know that it is burning fat, there must be two important points, that is, liver sugar is low enough (Note 2) and insulin is low enough (Note 3) . If you want to know more, there is a long explanation later, but in short, try not to eat high sugar foods, such as starch and sugar, and then eat more meat and eggs.\nNutritional ketosis In the state without sugar intake, because the brain and other organs cannot use fat as energy, the liver will metabolize fat and convert it into ketone bodies.\nWhen the concentration of ketones in the blood increases (Note 4), we call it ketosis, and ketosis caused by diet , we call it nutritional ketosis .\nDuring ordinary eating, the body also produces ketone bodies, but there are not many opportunities to produce them, and the production amount is not enough to reach the concentration of nutritional ketosis.\nThe ketogenic diet eats low-sugar, moderate, and high-protein oils in order to keep the body in nutritional ketosis for a longer period of time and a higher blood ketone concentration (representing fat burning) to determine the effect of reburning fat in the body.\nAfter entering stable ketosis, you can enjoy the benefits of a ketogenic diet, such as improving hormones, appetite, antioxidants, etc., and weight loss is usually a side effect.\nKetogenic ketosis Ketogenic period But before entering stable ketosis, there will be a \u0026ldquo;ketogenic adaptation period\u0026rdquo; , during which energy is not converted, so the body will feel very uncomfortable.\nMainly because ordinary people usually eat too much sugar, so the body is only used to use sugar as an energy source , and not used to burn fat.\nIt takes different time for everyone to fully enter stable ketosis. Ordinary people take about a week. If they eat high sugar for a long time, it may take longer.\nEntering stable ketosis means that your body's main energy source has become fat and ketone bodies to replace glucose.\nIt also means that fat has gone through a lot of difficulties and has been successfully broken down and used up.\n  Note 1: Carbohydrates are collectively referred to as sugars in this article, including starch, such as noodles, rice noodles, bread, and refined sugars, which are sweet sugars. After eating into the body, it will be stored in the blood in the form of glucose, or it will be stored in the muscle and liver as glycogen.\n  Note 2: Glycogen can only be produced by liver sugar at the lowest time.\n  In terms of a normal diet, it takes more than 12 hours for liver sugar to be consumed. So normal people can also produce ketone bodies after fasting for a while, but they break power as soon as they eat breakfast. When there is a lot of glycogen, even if there is a lot of free fat ready to be broken down by the liver, ketone bodies are difficult to make. When liver sugar is low enough, ketone bodies are produced quickly. Usually after the third day of the ketogenic diet, the amount of ketone bodies will be determined by the amount of free fat.\n Note 3: Ratio of Insulin to Glucagon  With insulin = storage lipase is stimulated, fat cannot be broken down in fat cells. Without insulin plus high catecholamines = fat can be broken down. Breaking down fat is very troublesome and there are many very slow steps. When fat can be broken down, triglycerides in fat cells are broken down into glycerol + three free fatty acids. Free fat adheres to albumin and is transported in the blood to where it is needed to provide energy. If there is sufficient energy in other parts of the body, it will be sent to the liver to be broken down, and ketone bodies will be produced, which will be transported in the blood to the organs needed for energy.\n Note 4: The concentration of ketones in the blood of people who eat a mixed diet (starch, vegetables, meat) will be less than 0.5mmol / L, and the blood ketone concentration will be about 0.6 ~ 3mmo / L under a stable ketogenic diet.  How to eat a ketogenic diet? As mentioned before, as long as insulin secretion is low and the amount of sugar in the body is low enough, the body can produce more ketones.\nSo in fact, as long as we try to avoid foods that are too high in sugar and foods that raise too much insulin, we can keep the body stable in ketosis.\nIn terms of the main nutrient ratio, 5% sugars (high FII), 20-25% protein (medium FII), and 70-75% fat (low FII) will be 99% of people who can enter stable nutrition ketones. Disease ratio.\nBut I would recommend to gradually enter the ketogenic diet in a gradual way.\nSugar is less than 40 grams a day, protein eats about 1 to 1.4 grams of body weight a day, and fat is adjusted according to appetite. This is done because most people are unable to eat so much fat in the beginning, they will be a little psychologically afraid, and physically uncomfortable, so they should eat comfortably first.\nIf you count the main nutrients, you can choose your own food and eat the target data. It will be a relatively simple starting point, and then fine-tuning it will be fine.\nWhat to eat with ketogenic If it does not count nutrients, you can refer to the following suggestions:\nCan eat more  Various meats (cow, chicken, duck, goose, etc.), animal offal (heart, liver, kidneys), eggs, fish (don't be too lean), vegetables (you can eat more than root vegetables), high-fat fruits (olive, avocado, coconut) Meat), seaweed  Can eat in moderation Seafood (usually high-protein, low-fat ingredients), onions, spices\nYou can eat less (don’t eat it if you don’t go to weight loss) Blueberries, cranberries, legumes (tofu, tofu), nuts\ndo not eat Various starch or high sugar foods\nImage Youtube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/resource/foods/what_is_a_ketogenic_diet/","tags":["foods"],"title":"what is ketogenic diet"},{"categories":["Health"],"contents":"What is mental illness?

The first person to record panic disorder was J. A. Hope , a British cardiologist . His cardiology textbook, written in 1832, contains a description of a patient with nervous palpitations.\n• There was nothing worse than that for the patient. He had a ridiculous imagination that he would die of an organic heart disease, and he was frightened by fear. The patient's thinking was very hard to shake off, because the depression and hopelessness of the neurotic condition that caused the patient's symptoms further fueled his imagination.\nIn 1871, US medical doctor Jacob Mendes DaCosta found that some of the soldiers who participated in the Civil War suddenly had chest pains, pain in the heart area, and difficulty breathing. DaCosta is a soldier to think outside the autonomic nervous system \u0026ldquo;sensitive heart (made actual heart disease, but the heart is sensitive by Boa severe activity and frequent exciting as things such as personal injury or severe physical illness during the battle caused the symptoms Irritable Heart )\u0026rdquo; Named it. This was much better known over the course of several wars since the \u0026quot; DaCosta syndrome\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the heart of the soldier ( Soldier's Heart )\u0026quot;, \u0026ldquo;efforts syndrome ( combination with Effort syndrome has called it).\u0026rdquo;\nIt wasn't until 1940 that these symptoms were accepted as an anxiety reaction and became known as a psychiatrist, not a physician, but a psychiatrist. Since then, panic disorder has been treated and treated like general anxiety symptoms and started to be treated separately from chronic anxiety by Donald Klein . Klein recently discovered that during clinical trials with imipramine, an antidepressant, he found that patients had fewer panic attacks and also found that panic symptoms occurred regardless of depression or other psychiatric symptoms. This led to a panic attack that was characterized by a sudden anxiety that was completely different from chronic anxiety.\nIn addition, a more scientific approach to the congestion of panic attacks has begun through tests of panic attack triggered by the injection of lactate by Pitts et al.\nWhat is panic disorder? Even if it's not a medical condition, when we are suddenly surprised or in extreme anxiety, we often say we're in panic. But the panic attacks we're going to talk about are the same, but they're a different concept.\nPanic is simply a sudden sense of fear that comes from a life-threatening situation. So panic is a reaction of our body that can appear normally in anyone who is actually life-threatening.\nPanic attacks, however, are a pathological condition that causes the body's alert system to malfunction and react as if they were threatened, although not particularly threatening.\nFor example, imagine you saw a robber with a knife while you were alone at night. Anyone reacts to their hair stuttering, their eyes wide open, their mouths wide open, their heart pounding sharply, their breathing jawless, their hands and feet trembling, and so on. You will taste fear.\nAnxiety in real dangerous situations has an important function that helps us protect ourselves. If we feel no anxiety under extreme circumstances, we will find it difficult to sustain life or be very injured. Therefore, the primary purpose of anxiety is to protect yourself from danger.\nHowever, if you do not try this experience at any time, not when you have to feel dangerous or insecure, it will be hard for you to continue your daily life.\nThis is a panic disorder!\nPanic and Panic Attacks\nCan I get panic disorder? Many people experience panic attacks in their lifetime. Some studies show that about 30% of the adult population has experienced more than one panic attack.\nHowever, these common panic attacks usually don't occur repeatedly at one time and are not diagnosed as panic disorder. Therefore, once you have experienced a panic attack, you do not have to think that you are a panic disorder.\nHowever, if panic attacks occur repeatedly and the seizures are not caused by any particular stress or physical cause, they can be diagnosed with panic disorder. The prevalence of panic disorder in our country is usually known to be 1 to 2%.\nMany people with panic disorder don't know they are panic disorders and are misunderstood that they have problems with their heart or other body. This is not just a phenomenon in Korea. Because symptoms of panic disorder are accompanied by so many physical symptoms, many people often take a long time to get proper treatment or help because they do not consider it a mental cause.\ncause  So why do these panic disorders happen?  Because of the treatment of panic disorder in psychiatry, many people think that panic disorder is caused by weak heart and fear. So I often think, \u0026lsquo;I'm not so weak, but I can't get panic disorder.\u0026rsquo; Because of the test, I often hear that there is no abnormality in my body and it seems to be neurotic symptoms.\nHowever, to date, panic disorder is known to be best explained by neurobiological causes. In addition, genetic and psychosocial factors are working together.\nFirst, a quick look at neurobiological causes are the substances that can cause panic attacks. The substances that can cause panic attacks are divided into neurochemical substances that act on the norepinephrine, serotonin, and GABA receptors of the central nervous system, hyperventilation, and respiratory substances that break the acid-base balance in vivo.\nIt is natural for a person to feel anxious in situations where he must be anxious, at which time an organ called the amygdala nucleus of the brain mediates various organs that cause anxiety. The cerebral cortex plays a role in misrecognizing and fearfully accepting a situation that will not be anxious, and the gray matter of the brain is responsible for causing a reaction to flee or freeze the fear. The hypothalamus stimulates the secretion of the sympathetic nervous system and hormones, such as sweating and heartburn, and the stimulus acts to stimulate the secretion of norepinephrine in the central nervous system. It will act as an adjustment.\nIn patients with panic disorder, their close relatives are said to have about 10 times more cases of panic disorder than the general population. In identical twins, when one has panic disorder, the other is also at a 45 percent chance of developing panic disorder. Recently, a lot of genetic research has been done, but no specific genes or chromosomal sites have been identified that are linked to panic disorder.\nPsychoanalysts say that panic attacks appear when an individual's unacceptable thoughts, wishes, and impulses are suppressed and unconscious, and at some point unconscious content is about to burst into consciousness. Also, losing parents or having anxiety when you were younger plays an important role, and many times you have a panic attack for the first time since you actually lost a close person or experienced severe mental stress.\nCognitive-behavioral theory suggests that anxiety is caused by learning or by conditional responses. For example, in the case of Mr. A, a panic attack first appeared during driving, so when you drive, you are reminded of your previous panic attack and you are easily anxious.\nIn addition, people with panic disorder are often more anxious because they are overly sensitive to minor changes in their senses. For example, if your heart beats faster or you have a slight feeling of tightness in your heart, you may be thinking that you may die of a heart attack.\nSymptom  Symptoms of Panic Attacks  A 33-year-old A was driving to work and suddenly, his chest jumped and seemed to be short of breath. A was scared of dying as soon as he was, leaving his car on his shoulder and calling 119 to go to the emergency room. But when I arrived at the emergency room and waited for a while, the symptoms subsided and I returned home after hearing that there was nothing wrong with the various tests. I was told there was nothing wrong, but these symptoms were repeated several times later, and each time the emergency room was told that there was nothing wrong with my body. When these things repeated, Mr. A was afraid that this would happen again and that fear prevented him from driving alone. A was advised to go to the psychiatrist in the emergency room, but he thought it was because he couldn't find his illness in the emergency room.\nIs A's story similar to yours? • You may feel short of breath or shortness of breath. • I feel dizzy, wobbly, or fainting. • Your pulse is getting faster or your heart is beating. • My hands and feet tremble. • I sweat. • You feel as if you are choking like someone is choking. • You may feel groaning or vomiting. • I feel like I'm in a different world, or I feel like I'm not myself. • Feeling limbs or numbness. • You feel burning or chilling. • You feel pain or discomfort in the chest area. • Feel the fear of dying. • You feel afraid to go crazy or lose control of yourself.\nIf four or more of the symptoms listed above occur suddenly and get worse and peak, within 10 minutes, you have a panic attack. Most panic attacks peak within 10 minutes of physical symptoms accompanied by anxiety, which lasts 20 to 30 minutes and then go away on their own. People with panic disorder do not always have panic attacks all day. The frequency of symptoms varies greatly from person to person, but only a few times a year, but in extreme cases, panic attacks may occur several times a day.\nWhen panic attacks occur again even when there are no panic attacks, there are many unpredictable anxieties. This is why many patients, like Mr. A, experience difficulties in their lives because of anxiety rather than panic attacks.\nDiagnosis of Panic Disorder • Panic disorder requires a repeated and unexpected panic attack. You may also continue to worry about panic attacks and other seizures or worry about the implications of panic attacks or their consequences (e.g. losing control over yourself or a heart attack). There must be a clear change. It should not be a direct symptom of addictive substances or drugs or general physical condition (such as hyperthyroidism) and should not be due to other mental illnesses such as social phobia, specific fear, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or anxiety disorder.\nAre you a panic disorder? In order to be diagnosed with panic disorder, the possibility of coronary artery disease such as myocardial infarction or angina pectoris, thyroid or parathyroid disease, epilepsy, pheochromocytoma, vestibular neuropathy, hypoglycemia and ventricular tachycardia should be discriminated. It is necessary to distinguish major depression, general anxiety disorder, social phobia, schizophrenia, somatoform disorder, borderline personality disorder, and adaptation disorder.\nTherefore, do not look at the symptoms and judge them quickly. Instead, see your psychiatrist for diagnosis.\nTreatment of Panic Disorder  Do I need panic disorder?  Is panic disorder an important disease? Panic disorder requires early diagnosis and early treatment.\nPanic disorder is a disease that can be cured most of the time if you get the right treatment at the right time. But if you don't get treatment, it's a disease that can progress.\nPanic disorder begins with no major difficulties in life except for the occasional panic attacks, which can lead to health problems due to repeated physical symptoms and tests. This situation is repeated, avoiding places or situations where panic attacks are likely to occur, and after that, we are afraid of all of our daily social activities, This can lead to a wide range of phobias, which can cause patients to feel hopeless, depressed, rely on alcohol, neuro stabilizers, or even commit suicide.\nIt is most important to start treatment as soon as possible so that you do not progress to this stage.\nMedication Medications for panic disorders are primarily recommended for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, a type of antidepressant. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are good therapeutic agents and safer, but anti-anxiety medications such as benzodiazepines are often used early in treatment because panic attacks usually take more than two to three weeks.\nMany psychiatric drugs are misleading because they are addictive and can damage the brain. In addition, it is not just a Health that calms down the symptoms today, but it also serves to cure and prevent recurrence. It is known that panic attacks may reappear in more than 50% of patients if they are stopped for a sufficient period of time, and studies show that the longer the duration of the drug use, the lower the recurrence rate.\nBenzodiazepines are used for the treatment of acute phase because they are very effective in reducing panic attacks. However, because it is a drug that can develop resistance, it is necessary to use it for a short time carefully according to the psychiatrist's prescription.\nThe most important aspect of medication is that it must be done according to the prescription and instructions of a psychiatrist. If the patient takes or discontinues the Health at random, the treatment may not be performed properly, but the anxiety may be worse.\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy is known to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder, and more effectively when combined with medication.\nCognitive behavioral therapy is a treatment that focuses on correcting behaviors that attempt to correct and avoid distorted thinking by revealing a close link between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Eventually, correcting distorted thoughts and actions reduces anxiety, fear, or panic attacks.\nCognitive behavioral treatment of panic disorder provides an intimate approach to patients and situations where panic disorders are subject to cognitive treatment and fear, which elaborates on patients with panic disorder and captures various prejudices that are misunderstood or misbelieved. Includes behavioral therapies to help you.\nTo do this, you must observe your symptoms or reactions objectively. For this purpose, you should prepare a panic record table, mood record table, etc. It is.\nIn addition to active treatment, some efforts are helpful in daily life. High levels of caffeine can aggravate panic disorders, so avoid using excessive amounts of caffeine-containing foods such as coffee, tea, and energy drinks. In addition, alcohol seems to relieve anxiety when you drink it, but it is better to stay away from alcohol because it can cause panic as you lose energy.\nYoutube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/resource/health/panic_disorder_treatment_of_panic_disorder/","tags":["Health"],"title":"What is Panic disorder How to Avoid And Diagnosis"},{"categories":["Health"],"contents":"Justice Pneumonia is an inflammation of the subbronchial area of ​​the lung (lung), especially in the alveoli (air pockets).\nPneumonia Pneumonia\ncause The most common cause is microbial infections, which are bacteria or viruses, and rarely can be fungal infections. In addition to infectious pneumonia caused by microorganisms, non-infectious pneumonia may be caused by aspiration of foreign substances such as chemicals or vomiting, aspiration of gases, or radiation therapy .\nSymptom Pneumonia causes inflammation of the lungs, impairing the normal functioning of the lungs, resulting in pulmonary symptoms and systemic symptoms throughout the body. Pulmonary symptoms include coughing caused by respiratory irritation, sputum caused by the release of inflammatory substances, and dyspnea caused by impaired breathing. Phlegm can come in sticky, pus-like appearance, and blood can come out. Inflammation of the pleura that surrounds the lungs can cause pain when breathing, and other than the respiratory system, digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can occur. In addition, systemic diseases throughout the body, such as headaches, fatigue, muscle pain , and joint pain , can occur. Systemic reactions of inflammation usually cause fever or chills.\nDiagnosis / Test First of all, it can be suspected through medical history listening and examination, and chest x-ray can be used to check for changes in lung shade. However , if no visible shadows are found on the x-ray , tests such as chest computed tomography ( CT ) may be done. Identifying the causative microorganisms is not easy, but it is possible to diagnose the causative organism through sputum culture, causative bacteria, blood culture test, or urine antigen test.\ncure Pneumonia caused by microorganisms is treated according to the causative organism, and antibiotics are treated. In general, pneumonia in the community is assumed to be bacterial pneumonia, empirically treated with antibiotics, and when the causative microorganism is identified, it is changed to an appropriate antibiotic. Viral pneumonia, such as influenza, has antiviral effects early in the onset of symptoms, but the effect of antiviral agents is less pronounced after a period of time.\nIf the condition is mild and hospitalization is not necessary, it is not necessary to be hospitalized and treated. However, inpatient treatment is recommended for children with low immunity, elderly patients and patients with severe diseases. Unless there is no complication or resistance to pneumonia caused by resistant drugs, treatment is usually enough for 10-14 days. If you are severely unable to breathe on your own, you should seek mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.\nProgress / Complications It has a very diverse course and varies according to the basic condition of the patient and the causative agent of pneumonia. Pneumonia may progress to sepsis or shock, and partial complications of the lung may be accompanied by empyema, pulmonary abscess, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe cases can lead to death.\nPrevention method There are vaccines to prevent pneumonia caused by flu or pneumococci. Pneumococcal vaccines do not provide complete protection against pneumonia, but are effective in reducing severe pneumococcal infections.\nTest Youtube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/resource/health/pneumonia/","tags":["health"],"title":"What is Pneumonia How to get rid of it"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/resource/health/signs_and_symptoms_early_signs_of_dementi/","tags":null,"title":""}]
