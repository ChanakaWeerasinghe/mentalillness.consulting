They have played an increasingly important part in medical. prescribing since the early 1940s, to the extent that it is widely felt that too many people have become dependent on large daily quantities of barbiturates. Nevertheless, these drugs are immensely useful. They are classified according to the length of time in which they are believed to exert their effect in the body. Ultra-short acting barbiturates include Brietal and Pentothal. These drugs have an immediate effect of such a short duration that they can be used as general anaesthetics. An injection given into a vein in the arm reaches the brain in about 1 Oseconds, and immedi-ately produces unconsciousness. From the effect of a single injection of Brietal or Pentothal the patient will remain \u0026lsquo;out\u0026rsquo; for several minutes, but in most operations, it is the practice to administer, in addition, an anaesthetic gas. Pentothal is widely referred to as \u0026lsquo;truth serum\u0026rsquo;. Of course, it is nothing of the kind, and the belief that people who are anaesthetized with it sud-denly divulge their innermost secrets is nonsense. All that can be said is that if a dilute solution of either of the drugs is injected into a .vein it will produce great mental relaxation. In such a state of relaxa-tion, it is possible that a person might be more willing to answer awkward questions. This property of producing relaxation is an important effect of all the barbiturate drugs, and, in fact, it has now been found possible to use even the ultra-short acting barbiturates in this way. Psychiatric patients who have some particular irra-tional fear (such as claustrophobia), or who areparalysed with fright in certain situations, can be given dilute intravenous D injections of barbiturates.

However, schizophrenia was not described until the late 1800s by Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926) and Eugen Bleuler (1857–1939). Kraeplin described the syndrome as a dementia praecox or decline in functioning with an early onset. The term ‘schizophrenia’ was first coined by Bleuler. The term itself is derived from two Greek words meaning ‘to split’ and ‘mind’ — a derivative that most likely contributes to the common misunderstanding that schizophrenia relates to split personality. Schizophrenia is not a split personality; it more closely resembles a split between a dream-state and reality. A person who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia will experience episodes of psychosis, including disturbances in perceptions and thinking. This in turn gives rise to unusual behaviour. There are a number of different types of schizophrenia; for example, paranoid, undifferentiated, catatonic and disorganised. Health professionals with an interest in this area are encouraged to seek out a specialist text on the different types of schizophrenia and what it is that differentiates them. Note that the term ‘schizophrenic’ is no longer used to describe a person who has schizophrenia due to the term’s pejorative connotations. Prevalence Schizophrenia is a disorder that typically develops in late adolescence or early adulthood. It affects both genders equally, but tends to be more severe and develop at an earlier age in males. Schizophrenia appears in about 0.3–0.7 per cent of the population of most countries, including Australia.\nPositive symptoms Health professionals are more likely to recognise the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. This is because they are most often overt and observable, unusual and extraordinary. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions and disorganised thinking. Hallucinations Hallucinations are usually described as false sensory perceptions, or perceptual phenomena arising without any external stimulus; for example, hearing (most common), seeing, smelling, feeling or tasting things that others do not. For people with a serious mental illness, the voices will often be persecutory and critical in nature, or may command the person to behave in a certain way. Hallucinations are described according to the sensory modality they affect and are referred to as follows.\n •\tAuditory — hearing things that are not there •\tVisual — seeing things that are not there. For example, ‘When I was unwell in hospital, I could see a young boy leaning over a small animal. I asked other people whether they could see it. They said no.’ •\tTactile — feeling things that are not there, such as feeling the presence of a parasite under the skin. •\tGustatory — tasting things that are not there. For example, ‘I started getting this weird taste in my mouth. It was salty. Then I worked out that it was sweat I was tasting. I couldn’t get away from the taste of sweat. I started drinking water, then I tried sweet drinks, but the taste of sweat would always come back. That lasted for about a week.’ •\tOlfactory — smelling things that are not there. For example, ‘Burning rubber was all I could smell. It stank! When I first started to smell it,  Delusions A delusion is a fixed and false belief that the person cannot be dissuaded from despite contradictory evidence. The belief is not based in the person’s cultural, religious/spiritual, educational or social experience and is maintained despite it not being shared by other members of the same culture. For example, believing that there is the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe would be in keeping with the beliefs of many other people in society, but believing that the health worker is an alien would not be in keeping with beliefs of others and so would be classified as a delusion.\nDelusions can also be bizarre or non-bizarre in nature. Bizarre delusions are beliefs that are implausible. For example, a person may believe that an alien has put a camera in their brain. Based upon scientific evidence, there is no likelihood that this has actually occurred. On the other hand, a non-bizarre delusion would involve a belief that on a balance of probability could possibly occur. For example, a person may believe that their manager is constantly checking up on them. Before writing off a belief as a delusion, health professionals are always wise to explore the person’s context, life experiences and the level of the belief. For example, is the person obsessed with the belief? How much is the belief driving their behaviour or consuming their lives? Answers to these questions are perhaps more significant to the care and treatment provided than the content of the delusions.\nDelusions may also be described in relation to their relationship with the person’s mood. For example, an individual whose mood is low may become utterly convinced that a particular person or group of people hates them. However, a delusion can also be mood neutral; for example, a person may believe that people with dark hair all follow a particular football team. More generally, delusions are classified according to theme. The most common of these themes are as follows.\n •\tPersecutory or paranoid delusions — a false belief that a person is the victim of a conspiracy. A person may believe they are being spied on, poisoned or about to be harmed in some way. •\tGrandiose delusions — a false belief that a person possesses special powers, talents or abilities. This may extend to a belief that they are royalty, a film star, an entrepreneur or millionaire, or a leader in their field. •\tSomatic delusions — a false belief that a person has an illness, which is not supported by medical evidence. Great care must be taken by health professionals to ensure that the symptoms being reported actually are delusional. People with a mental illness do become physically ill and some illnesses are difficult to diagnose. Just because a person has been diagnosed with a serious mental illness does not mean the symptoms the person reports are not real. •\tIdeas of references — a false belief that insignificant events have personal significance. This often displays itself in a person believing the television or radio has special messages for them. •\tReligious delusions — a false belief with religious or spiritual content. This can display as the person believing they are Jesus Christ or a special prophet who has come to save the world. As with hallucinations, when the person is relatively well, they may be able to recognise that these delusions are false personal beliefs. This level of insight helps the person to challenge their own thinking.  Disorganised thinking The types of disorganised thinking experienced by people with schizophrenia can vary. However, disorganised thinking is most often exhibited by the way the person speaks to the health professional. Disorganised thinking can lead to conversation that lacks structure and purpose or remains focused on the specific issue or idea that is causing distress for the person. Disorganised thinking is exhibited through speech and includes:\nNegative symptoms The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are generally less obvious than the positive symptoms. This is because the symptoms involve the withdrawal or retreat of the person from social contact. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are also more difficult to manage or treat; although the more recent atypical antipsychotic medications have been found to be helpful. atypical antipsychotic medications the newer generation of antipsychotic medications that treat psychosis\nUPON REFLECTION Schizophrenia’s negative symptoms The negative symptoms of schizophrenia include a lack of motivation and initiative, cognitive deficits and apathy. Questions\n How do these symptoms influence the provision of clinical treatment and the role that a health professional will need to take? What ethical and treatment considerations could arise for the health professional working with a patient from a diverse cultural background who is experiencing a religious delusion? How can health professionals engage with people experiencing negative symptoms to promote healthy and socially active lifestyle choices? Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are often very frustrating for the person who is experiencing them. They can also be quite distressing for partners, carers and family members. Examples of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are as follows.   •\tBlunted emotions. A person’s emotional responses are restricted, making them appear to be disinterested and withdrawn. •\tCognitive deficits. These impact upon the person’s ability to communicate; for example, the person may have difficulty in concentrating and be slow to react to sensory input. •\tApathy. The person has difficulty in undertaking straightforward tasks. They may appear slow and unmotivated. As already noted, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are less responsive to treatment than the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Even so, a range of treatment options is available for the symptoms of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medication may be prescribed and is usually continued on a long-term basis. A combination of pharmacological, social and psychological interventions, plus help and support to undertake specific activities of daily living, is the usual approach to treatment.

Typical symptoms are as follows.\n  Panic disorder : Suddenly severe fear or discomfort peaks in minutes, while physical symptoms such as shortness of breath, tightness of the chest, increased heart rate, sweating, and severe anxiety and fear of dying . There is a fear of panic attacks coming back, so avoid places or situations that you think are related to them and often avoid activities that resemble panic symptoms, such as running, climbing stairs, and arguing.\n  Agoraphobia : Extreme fear and anxiety in situations such as using public transportation, being in an open space such as a park, being in an enclosed space such as a movie theater, being in a line or in a crowd, or being alone outside the house. In this case, the condition of avoiding such situation lasts more than six months. In general, it is often closely related to panic disorder.\n  Anxiety disorder: Excessive anxiety and anxiety about minor and everyday tasks lasts for a long time and is often difficult to control and is often accompanied by various physical symptoms associated with anxiety (insomnia, increased muscle tone, etc.).\n  Social Anxiety Disorders : Characteristic symptoms experience significant fear and anxiety in social situations that can be closely monitored or negatively assessed, leading to the avoidance of such social situations.\n  specific phobia: Excessive fear of a particular object or situation causes almost no excessive fear, such as crying, sitting down or losing consciousness when contacted with high places, snakes, insects, blood, syringe needles, etc. Panic attacks often occur.\n  Anxiety Disorder: The most common anxiety disorder in children under 12 years of age. When the subject forming the main attachment is located next to them, they feel relieved. Frequent fears of unhappy things can happen to them and their parents, and they often show concern by complaining of physical symptoms such as abdominal pain, headache, nausea and vomiting.\n  Selective narcolepsy: I don't have a problem talking to close people like my parents or siblings, but I don't speak with strangers or in certain situations.\n  Diagnosis / Test Anxiety disorders are diagnosed through consultation with mental health physicians, medical history listening and Q \u0026amp; A. If necessary, a symptom assessment questionnaire can assess the severity of the disease.\nTests such as blood tests or brain imaging ( such as magnetic resonance imaging ) are performed to differentiate between other neurological and medical conditions that may cause anxiety .\ncure After the diagnosis process, the treatment may vary depending on the detailed diagnosis of the anxiety disorder, but drug treatment using antidepressants and anti-anxiety agents is most often used. Antianxiety medications are used to immediately relieve anxiety symptoms, and antidepressants take more than two weeks to take effect. Cognitive behavioral therapy can be used as a non-drug therapy in panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, specific phobia and social phobia among anxiety disorders . It is a combination of behavioral therapy that corrects cognitive errors, exposes patients to anxiety-causing factors, and then controls their anxiety symptoms and behaviors.\nDepending on the diagnosis, the appropriate treatment technique will be applied and practiced for 8 to 16 different time periods. Other psychoanalytic therapies deal with the unconscious part of the mind associated with anxiety. Each treatment is optionally prescribed according to the patient's condition after an accurate diagnosis by the psychiatrist.\nProgress / Complications Appropriate treatment can reduce anxiety and recover, but in many cases relapses can occur and become chronic. Anxiety disorders are often accompanied by mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder, and when alcohol is frequently used to reduce anxiety, addictive diseases such as alcohol dependence may occur.\nPrevention method Anxiety disorders are caused by a variety of causes, most of which are difficult to prevent. However, it is necessary to control and manage stress through relaxation such as relaxation, hobbies and deep breathing.\nDiet / Life Guide You need an attitude that understands and supports the anxious patient. And it is not a good idea to inadvertently expose the patient to anxiety-causing factors. Considering the patient's condition, it is desirable to adjust the exposure level to anxiety factors and learn how to respond according to the prescription of the mental health doctor.\nThere is no food that helps to alleviate anxiety disorders. Occasionally, if a panic disorder patient eats caffeine-containing foods such as coffee and chocolate, he or she may be asked to avoid these foods because of heart rate changes. Good to see Drinking alcohol to control anxiety, which is not a good way because it can cause physical illnesses such as liver disease, as well as other mental illnesses such as alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence.\nYoutube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/blog/health/how_to_get_rid_of_anxiety_disorder/","tags":["mental"],"title":"How to get rid of Anxiety"},{"categories":["Health"],"contents":"Causes Did You Know Bipolar disorder Bipolar disorder affects 0.6 and 0.8 per cent (for bipolar I and bipolar II respectively) of the population at some time in their lives (APA, 2013). Onset is usually before the age of 30 years, but can occur at any time. The most common pattern involves repeated episodes of mania or depression, usually followed by a period of remission. Genetics are thought to be largely responsible for determining an individual’s likelihood of developing a bipolar disorder. In families where one person has bipolar disorder, there are often other family members who have experienced episodes of depressive illness or hypomania.\nMania People who experience a mania often have disjointed or distorted thinking. Hallucinations and delusions are also common and often appear very real to the person. People can also experience ‘mystical experiences’ where they see special connections between events or other experiences. During an episode of mania, the person is at risk of behaving in an antisocial way (which may be out of character for them) and this may lead to serious financial, legal and relationship problems. The person may neglect their personal hygiene and physical health, and other symptoms of mental illness may also be present.\nThis often leads to the person being hospitalised. mania an episode of highly elevated mood which interferes significantly in day-to-day life grandiosity overvalued sense of self — often related to elevated mood state in bipolar disorder\nHypomania is similar to mania; however, the symptoms are less severe and cause less impairment for the individual. Usually no psychotic features are evident in a hypomanic episode and the person may not require hospitalisation (APA, 2013). In addition to mania and/or hypomania, the person with a bipolar disorder will typically experience episodes of depression. The frequency or lengths of the cycles between mania and depression will depend upon the person’s individual experience. However, mood stabilising medication will often give rise to longer periods between the highs and the lows, as well as decreasing the extremes of the highs and lows.\nMental Health Care An Introduction for Health Professionals in Australia Hungerford | Hodgson | Clancy | Monisse-Redman | Bostwick | Jones Youtube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/blog/health/bipolar_disorder/","tags":["health"],"title":"How to treat A ‘manic depression’.

When they are small, they pass out of our bodies through urine, but when they are large, many stones in the urinary system, such as the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, Can cause problems.\nKidney stones can irritate and injure surrounding tissues and cause very severe hematuria. If large enough to block the flow of urine, urine does not drain from one kidney, resulting in swelling and severe pain in the side. It also reduces the function of the kidneys. In addition, as the stones pass, they can easily cause infections of the urinary system, causing symptoms of urinary tract infections such as fever and cloudy urine.\nPain from kidney stones can occur suddenly and cause extreme pain, which can frighten many people, but in most cases, life-threatening problems can be resolved on their own or resolved with simple treatment. Almost no\nIf kidney stones recur frequently, it is necessary to identify the risk factors that cause them for some reason. In other words, if the concentration of certain substances rises or is insufficient, kidney stones may occur, so if the patient's stones come out in the urine, it is necessary to analyze what components are present. This analysis is very important because it allows for accurate prevention. Even if the exact cause is not known, drinking enough water and adjusting your diet can reduce the frequency of occurrence.\nCauses and Risks 1. The process of development of kidney stones The kidneys are two bean-sized fist-sized organs, one on each side of the lower back spine. The main function of the kidneys is to mix and discharge water, various electrolytes and metallic minerals, toxins, etc. from our bodies into the urine.\nIn most cases, kidney stones are not a single factor, but a combination of factors.\nKidney stones occur when the balance of these various components in the urine is broken. Kidney stones can also occur if urine is low and there are ingredients in the urine that can make crystals of various substances. Kidney stones can also occur if your urine is overly acidic or alkaline, and can also occur when your body does not properly absorb the special components in your urine.\nThere are many substances that make up kidney stones. Kidney stones are easily formed when the concentration of calcium, oxalate , and uric acid increases in the urine, depending on the infection, food, drug, or body condition . The composition of the stones depends on these factors, and the most common kidney stones are kidney stones that contain calcium. Knowing the components of kidney stones can also help determine the cause of kidney stones.\n2. Types of Kidney Stones According to Ingredients Analyzing kidney stones released by the body reveals the composition of the stones. Kidney stones are classified according to their composition as follows.\n calcium stones  80% of kidney stones are made up of calcium, which is chemically calcium oxalate . Fish is present in some fruits and vegetables, but most of the fish in our bodies comes from metabolism in the liver. Certain foods, high intakes of vitamin D, surgery in some intestines, and various metabolic disorders increase calcium and oxalate levels in the urine, forming calcium stones.\nstruvite ( Struvite ) absent  These stones are common in women, and most are caused by a urinary tract infection. These stones can grow large enough to fill the space where urine collects on one kidney, and in this case, they can be shaped like antlers along the shape of a python.\nuric acid stones  This stone is formed by uric acid and is a byproduct of protein metabolism in our bodies. If you continue to eat high protein, you may have uric acid stones. It can also occur in patients with gout, and if there are genetic factors or metabolic disorders, it can be caused by uric acid in the urine as the uric acid in the blood increases.\ncystine stones  A relatively rare type of kidney stone that occurs in people with a condition in which a specific amino acid (cystine) is genetically released through the kidneys.\nRisk Factors for Kidney Stones  The following factors are known to increase the risk of kidney stones.  lack of moisture  If you don't drink enough water, your urine will concentrate, resulting in an increase in the concentration of many substances that can make kidney stones, which can lead to kidney stones. Especially if you sweat a lot during the hot season and lose a lot of water, kidney stones may occur if you do not replenish the water properly.\nfamily or individual medical history  If someone in your family has or has had kidney stones, they are more likely to have kidney stones than people who do not have them. And people who have had a history of kidney stones are more likely to have stones again than people who do not.\nage and gender  Most kidney stones occur between the ages of 20 and 70, and men are more prone to kidney stones than women.\nDietary  Protein-rich, salty and low-calcium foods increase the likelihood of kidney stones.\nlack of exercise  Kidney stones can easily occur if you live in bed or just sit in a chair at work. This lack of exercise can lead to the release of calcium from the bones, causing them to accumulate in the kidneys, leading to partial kidney stones.\nobesity  People with high body mass index, high waist circumference, and being overweight have a high frequency of kidney stones in the long run. This is more pronounced for women.\nhigh blood pressure  The incidence of kidney stones in people with high blood pressure is about twice that of people with normal blood pressure.\nPeople who have undergone gastric bypass surgery, patients with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea  Gastric bypass surgery is a person who has a stomach and small intestine directly connected to the stomach, such as a stomach ulcer or cancer. People who have these surgeries, those with inflammatory bowel disease, and those with chronic diarrhea can change kidney absorption by changing the absorption of calcium in food and increasing the concentration of substances in the stones.\nSymptoms and Complications  Symptoms of Kidney Stones  Symptoms associated with kidney stones can vary depending on the size of the stone, the location of the stone, and the presence of an infection.\nCommon symptoms of kidney stones include:  Pain in the back or side: A sudden, very severe pain that many people feel is one of the worst pains in their life. The pain may worsen and then improve and may last for 20 to 60 minutes once occurring. hematuria: Some people see urine that contains clear blood that can be clearly seen by their eyes, but a small amount of blood that is invisible to the eye and can be seen under a microscope is mixed with urine. Urinary tract: A smell or turbid color of urine comes out of the eye. Nausea and vomiting: Can occur if kidney stones affect the digestive system. Fever and chills: May occur when inflammation is caused by kidney stones. Frequent urination : Frequent urination symptoms. Urination : It is difficult to hold urine as soon as urine comes out. dysuria: The symptoms are pain when you urinate occurs.  Although one or more of these symptoms may appear, a combination of symptoms usually occurs. On the other hand, some patients rarely feel any symptoms, and they may find kidney stones by accident during a physical exam or other tests to diagnose other illnesses.\nComplications of Kidney Stones  If kidney stones remain in one kidney, they grow very large or cause infection. However, they may not cause any other symptoms or complications unless they block the flow of urine.\nIf a stone is caught in any of the urine's pathways and blocks the flow of urine, stagnant urine can cause increased pressure, which can cause pain, damage the kidneys, and cause bleeding and infection.\nDiagnosis In general, the diagnosis of kidney stones may require the following tests:\n1. Listen to troops To identify risk factors for kidney stones. Severe, sudden onset of age, sex, eating habits, drinking water frequently, whether you have kidney stones in your family, whether you have had kidney stones before, and whether the pain you complain is in your lower back or side Check for pain.\n2. Physical examination Identify the area that complains of pain, especially if you are knocking on one side of your lower back.\n3. Blood test Your blood may be checked for high concentrations of substances that cause kidney stones, such as uric acid, and if necessary, special tests may be done to check your minerals and amino acids. You can also check whether kidney failure is caused by kidney stones and whether white blood cells are elevated due to inflammation.\n4. Urine test Check the color and smell of the urine, and make sure that red blood cells, which should not normally be present under the microscope, are not mixed with urine, even if the visible blood is not mixed.\n5. Imaging Medical Examination Test Test Test  abdominal radiography  X-rays of the abdomen can reveal stones in most kidneys and reveal the location and size of kidney stones. However, stones that are made up of some specific components (uric acid) may transmit radiation and may not be detected by radiography.\nKidney stones found on abdominal radiography 2) abdominal ultrasound\nRadiofrequency examinations have the advantages of no pain, no safety, and no exposure to radiation. However, it is easy to miss small stones in the ureters or bladder.\nAbdominal computed tomography ( CT )  This test is very helpful in finding kidney stones in the acute phase and urinary stones. Even small stones can be found, and the location and size of all stones above a certain size can be determined by the resolution of the shooting machine, regardless of the composition.\nCT Findings of Kidney Stones 3) Urinary Angiography\nThis test involves taking a drug called a contrast agent, which can appear white on a radiograph through a vein, and then the radiation is filtered through the kidneys and passed through the ureter, bladder, and urinary tract. Urinary angiography is a very useful test to determine the location of kidney stones, and if the stones block the flow of urine, it can help to determine the urinary system. Recently, computed tomography ( CT ) replaces this test in many cases.\nUrinary tract imaging Precautions when Performing Urinary Imaging\nContrast agent is an iodine injection containing iodine, which does not easily pass through x- rays. The contrast agent is then excreted along the ureter through the kidneys, resulting in empty spaces on the X- ray image of stones present inside the ureter.\nContrast agents, on the other hand, can be used to more clearly distinguish abnormal areas in organs, such as cancer, in tests such as CT .\nHowever, contrast agents may rarely cause side effects, especially in people with allergies, asthma and severe illnesses such as heart disease, and those with past drug side effects. In most cases, the side effects of injections of the contrast agent are mild, including nausea, hives, itching, spots or redness of the face, coughing, hoarseness, runny nose, and shortness of breath.\nHowever, just as rarely as a bee-killed person dies from a severe allergic reaction, one in every 30,000 or 100,000 people who have received a contrast agent has reported a very serious form of allergic reaction.\nIn order to prevent such risks, prior to conducting a test that injects contrast agents, the patient's past history is to determine whether there is a history of contrast agent side effects or risk factors for contrast agent side effects.\ncure  Early Pain Treatment  In many cases, small kidney stones (typically less than 5 mm ) are excreted in the urine by themselves, so there is often no treatment other than pain control. However, pain from urinary tract stones is so severe and intense that an appropriate analgesic agent is needed, and sometimes an antispasmodic medication that relaxes the urinary tract contractions.\nTreatment to excrete in urine  For small stones, infusion of fluid or drinking plenty of water may help to induce natural excretion into the urine.\nExtracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotomy ( ESWL )  This procedure is a common method for kidney or urinary stones.\nExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy can be used in stones where natural discharge is considered difficult, especially stones of some size. In this method, before the procedure, the location of the stones is determined by the imaging method. Then, an ultrasonic shock wave is applied to the stones to break the stones into small pieces and then discharge them naturally.\nExtracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy This procedure may be done after a simple anesthesia, and it may sound quite loud when a shock wave is applied, but it is rarely dangerous for the patient.\nComplications from this procedure can be temporary bloody urine and temporary bleeding of the kidneys or surrounding tissue. Also, if the stones are not completely crushed, it may be necessary to repeat the procedure several times or remove the remaining stones by urinary endoscopic examination.\nAfter the procedure, stones may be excreted over a few weeks, depending on the patient.\nIf extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is not successful or the size of the stone is large, urological surgery is used to make a small incision in the patient's back and remove the stone using a device called a nephroscope.\nPercutaneous Stone Removal 5. Stone removal using ureteroscope\nThis procedure is a method to remove stones that do not drain from the ureters. Use a small endoscope to enter the bladder, then remove the stone by using an instrument mounted on the endoscope. In recent years, the endoscope can be equipped with ultrasound or a laser to break up and remove some stones.\nStone Removal Using Urinary Endoscopy 6. Medical Medication\nIf the substance that makes up the stone can be dissolved by the drug, you can try to dissolve the stone by dispensing the appropriate drug and drain it into the urine.\nprevention To prevent the development of kidney stones, lifestyle modifications and medications can be taken to prevent the formation of stones.\n Lifestyle correction   much water intake  Drinking lots of fluids, and therefore urinating too much, prevents the formation of stones and makes them easier to urinate. To do this, it is recommended that you drink at least 2 to 3 liters of water and at least 2 liters of urine a day. However, if it is difficult to measure the correct amount, it is better to drink enough water to urinate so that the color is almost colorless when you urinate. This is because thick urine means that you have not consumed enough fluid in concentrated urine.\nGood drinks to prevent kidney stones  Water is best for rehydration. Other than that, it is best to drink a glass of lemonade (although this is not a common drink in our country). If lemonade is difficult to obtain, lemon juice or orange juice has a similar effect. Drinking these juices is known to increase citrate in our body, which is known to prevent the formation of stones.\nAvoiding Foods That Cause Kidney Stones  The most common foods that cause calcium stones are oxalic acid-rich foods that combine with calcium to form stones. Avoid these foods as much as possible to avoid kidney stones. These foods include rhubarb, kale, beans, spinach, sweet potatoes, almonds, and sesame seeds. These foods are generally known to be good for health, and they are supplied in the form of green juice. If you have a family member with kidney stones or have had kidney stones, you should consider them well.\nIncrease your calcium intake  In fact, eating a lot of calcium-rich food does not mean you have more calcium stones. Conversely, eating calcium-rich foods helps prevent kidney stones because this calcium is excreted in the stool in combination with the fishery that makes stones in your intestines. Therefore, calcium intake should be actively recommended to prevent kidney stones. The exception is that too much calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract can cause kidney stones, so avoid excessive intake.\nPrevention using drugs  When the kidney stones are analyzed and the components of the stones are identified, they can be prescribed to prevent the recurrence. For example, to prevent calcium stones, you can try to prevent them by choosing one of the diuretics. The choice of such drugs requires the judgment of a specialist.\nYoutube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/blog/health/kidney_stones/","tags":["health"],"title":"Kidney stones How to Diagnose Kidney stones and Get Rid of Kidney stones "},{"categories":["Health"],"contents":"hypersensitive reactions Giving antibiotics to babies may increase their threat for developing hypersensitive reactions, a new take a look at suggests.\nResearchers used records of 798,426 kids inside the Military Health System database from 2001 to 2013, tracking their antibiotic prescriptions in infancy and hypersensitivity diagnoses in childhood.

Antibiotic medicinal drugs are broadly used inside the remedy and prevention of such infections.They can also both kill or inhibit the growth of micro organism. A restricted range of antibiotics additionally possess antiprotozoal activity. Antibiotics are not powerful toward viruses consisting of the not unusual bloodless or influenza; drugs which inhibit viruses are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals instead of antibiotics.\nSometimes, the time period antibiotic which means \u0026ldquo;opposing life\u0026rdquo;, based mostly on Greek roots, (ἀντι-) anti: \u0026ldquo;closer to\u0026rdquo; and (βίος-) biotic: \u0026ldquo;life\u0026rdquo;, is broadly used to consult any substance used in competition to microbes, but inside the common medical usage, antibiotics (together with penicillin) are the ones produced naturally (by means of one microorganism fighting another), whereas nonantibiotic antibacterials (such as sulfonamides and antiseptics) are clearly synthetic. However, both lessons have the same aim of killing or stopping the growth of microorganisms, and each are blanketed in antimicrobial chemotherapy. \u0026ldquo;Antibacterials\u0026rdquo; consist of antiseptic capsules, antibacterial soaps, and chemical disinfectants, whereas antibiotics are an crucial elegance of antibacterials used more particularly in Health and now and again in cattle feed.\nAntibiotics were used since ancient times.

Overview Although there are known, powerful remedies for intellectual problems, among 76% and 85% of humans in low- and middle-income nations receive no treatment for their disorder(2). Barriers to powerful care include a loss of resources, loss of trained health-care vendors and social stigma related to intellectual issues. Another barrier to effective care is incorrect assessment.

During a intense depressive episode, it is not likely that the victim will be able to maintain with social, work or domestic activities, except to a restricted extent.\nBipolar affective sickness: this type of depression usually includes each manic and depressive episodes separated by using durations of ordinary temper. Manic episodes involve improved or irritable mood, over-activity, stress of speech, inflated self-esteem and a decreased need for sleep.\nContributing factors and prevention There are interrelationships between melancholy and bodily fitness. For example, cardiovascular disorder can lead to melancholy and vice versa.\nPrevention programmes had been shown to reduce depression. Effective community processes to prevent depression consist of college-based totally programmes to beautify a sample of tremendous questioning in children and adolescents. Interventions for parents of children with behavioural issues may lessen parental depressive symptoms and improve results for their children. Exercise programmes for the elderly can also be powerful in depression prevention.\nDiagnosis and remedy  Health-care carriers may provide mental remedies which include behavioural activation cognitive behavioural remedy (CBT) interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) antidepressant medicinal drug along with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  Health-care carriers must hold in thoughts the possible unfavorable effects associated with antidepressant medicine, the capacity to supply either intervention (in terms of expertise, and/or treatment availability), and man or woman preferences.

People with melancholy may additionally have more than one physical proceedings with no obvious bodily cause. Depression may be long-lasting or recurrent, appreciably impairing people’s capacity to function at work or college and to address every day existence. At its maximum intense, melancholy can cause suicide.\nPrevention programmes have been proven to reduce melancholy, both for youngsters (e.G. thru protection and psychological guide following bodily and sexual abuse) and adults (e.G. via psychosocial assistance after screw ups and conflicts).\nThere are also effective treatments. Mild to moderate despair can be correctly handled with talking therapies, along with cognitive behaviour therapy or psychotherapy. Antidepressants may be an effective form of treatment for slight to excessive depression but aren't the primary line of treatment for cases of mild despair. They should now not be used for treating despair in children and aren't the primary line of remedy in adolescents, amongst whom they must be used with caution.\nManagement of depression must encompass psychosocial aspects, including identifying stress factors, together with financial problems, problems at work or bodily or mental abuse, and resources of assist, together with circle of relatives contributors and friends. The maintenance or reactivation of social networks and social sports is crucial.\nThis sickness affects about forty five million human beings worldwide1. It typically includes each manic and depressive episodes separated through periods of ordinary mood. Manic episodes involve accelerated or irritable mood, over-activity, fast speech, inflated vanity and a decreased need for sleep. People who have manic assaults but do not enjoy depressive episodes also are classified as having bipolar sickness.\nEffective treatments are to be had for the remedy of the extreme phase of bipolar disorder and the prevention of relapse. These are medicines that stabilize mood. Psychosocial support is an important thing of remedy.\nSchizophrenia and other psychoses Stigma and discrimination can bring about a scarcity of access to health and social offerings. Furthermore, humans with psychosis are at high danger of exposure to human rights violations, which includes long-term confinement in institutions.\nSchizophrenia typically starts offevolved in late formative years or early adulthood. Treatment with drugs and psychosocial aid is effective. With appropriate remedy and social help, affected humans can lead a productive existence and be integrated in society.

Much can be done, however, to guide and improve the lives of people with dementia and their carers and families.\nIntellectual incapacity is characterized by impairment of skills across more than one developmental regions consisting of cognitive functioning and adaptive behaviour. Lower intelligence diminishes the potential to conform to the each day demands of existence.\nSymptoms of pervasive developmental issues, along with autism, include impaired social behaviour, conversation and language, and a narrow range of interests and activities which are both particular to the man or woman and are completed repetitively. Developmental problems regularly originate in infancy or early adolescence.

The busy lifestyle of many Americans often leads to poor eating habits. It is a lot easier to go through the drive through and get a bag full of cheeseburgers and French fries than it is to stop at the grocery store a buy healthy, nutritious food that you will have to go home and prepare and then have to dirty kitchen to clean up. One could argue that it is cheaper to eat fast food than it is to eat a vegetarian diet, but the cost of poor heath is much higher. In a 2008 report published by Mayo Clinic Health Solutions, they state that obesity related claims accounted for 2.8% of health care costs. This might not seem like much, bit 2.8% of the $2 trillion that the U.S. spends on health care is a lot of money. The report also states that for every one point increase in BMI (body mass index) that medical costs increase by $119.70 and medication costs go up by $82.60\nIntroducing the ketogenic diet Negative Health Impacts of Vegetarian Diet BMC stands for Bone mineral content and BMD stands for bone mineral density and are measurements of one’s bone density. The report claims that the decrease in bone mass is due to the low calorie and low protein intake associated with a raw food vegetarian diet. In an article by Craig (2009) the health effects of a vegetarian diet were analyzed. A strict vegan is at a slight risk of being deficient in n-3 polyunsaturated fats, vitamin D, iron, vitamin B-12, and zinc. The risk of these deficiencies is not significant in partial vegetarians that consume fish, eggs, and sea vegetables (2009). They suggest that for vegans to get the necessary nutrients they should be sure to eat fortified foods and/or take vitamin supplements. The article confirms the benefits of reduced BMI, lower serum cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and lower risk of cardiovascular disease.

Foreword The ketogenic diet is one of the most popular diets in the near future. 70% of people use it to lose weight and 30% of them take care of their health. Most people will fall in love with this diet after using it, but 90% of people in the fitness industry will object to a ketogenic diet Is a ketogenic diet really such an effective weight loss diet ? Is ketogenic really so bad for bodybuilders? I need you to put down all your prejudice against ketogenic diet, and keep a neutral perspective on this ketogenic diet article. I will honestly use research papers and personal experience to analyze the good and bad of ketogenic diet.\nIntroducing the ketogenic diet People often ask me how to eat a ketogenic diet, then we can first see the picture below Half of the plates in the ketogenic diet are lean meat or eggs, and then half are vegetables, which probably looks like this. (This meat looks thin, but I use a lot of oil to cook it)\nKetogenic diet You may see on the Internet that the ketogenic diet is the right amount of protein , good enough fat, and low enough sugars, such as 70% fat, 25% protein, 5% sugars and the like. But this will be explained in more detail in the next article, \u0026ldquo;How to eat a ketogenic diet\u0026rdquo;. Ketogenic mean, so that the body can produce \u0026ldquo;life\u0026rdquo; , more \u0026quot; one\u0026rdquo; body diet in order to stay stable nutritional ketosis (Nutritional Ketosis) as the goal. So why do you produce ketone bodies? Because ketone bodies are metabolites after burning fat when the body's sugar (Note 1) content is low enough, a high blood ketone concentration is equivalent to knowing that fat is now being burned as energy. In order for the body to produce enough ketone bodies and know that it is burning fat, there must be two important points, that is, liver sugar is low enough (Note 2) and insulin is low enough (Note 3) . If you want to know more, there is a long explanation later, but in short, try not to eat high sugar foods, such as starch and sugar, and then eat more meat and eggs.\nNutritional ketosis In the state without sugar intake, because the brain and other organs cannot use fat as energy, the liver will metabolize fat and convert it into ketone bodies.\nWhen the concentration of ketones in the blood increases (Note 4), we call it ketosis, and ketosis caused by diet , we call it nutritional ketosis .\nDuring ordinary eating, the body also produces ketone bodies, but there are not many opportunities to produce them, and the production amount is not enough to reach the concentration of nutritional ketosis.\nThe ketogenic diet eats low-sugar, moderate, and high-protein oils in order to keep the body in nutritional ketosis for a longer period of time and a higher blood ketone concentration (representing fat burning) to determine the effect of reburning fat in the body.\nAfter entering stable ketosis, you can enjoy the benefits of a ketogenic diet, such as improving hormones, appetite, antioxidants, etc., and weight loss is usually a side effect.\nKetogenic ketosis Ketogenic period But before entering stable ketosis, there will be a \u0026ldquo;ketogenic adaptation period\u0026rdquo; , during which energy is not converted, so the body will feel very uncomfortable.\nMainly because ordinary people usually eat too much sugar, so the body is only used to use sugar as an energy source , and not used to burn fat.\nIt takes different time for everyone to fully enter stable ketosis. Ordinary people take about a week. If they eat high sugar for a long time, it may take longer.\nEntering stable ketosis means that your body's main energy source has become fat and ketone bodies to replace glucose.\nIt also means that fat has gone through a lot of difficulties and has been successfully broken down and used up.\n  Note 1: Carbohydrates are collectively referred to as sugars in this article, including starch, such as noodles, rice noodles, bread, and refined sugars, which are sweet sugars. After eating into the body, it will be stored in the blood in the form of glucose, or it will be stored in the muscle and liver as glycogen.\n  Note 2: Glycogen can only be produced by liver sugar at the lowest time.\n  In terms of a normal diet, it takes more than 12 hours for liver sugar to be consumed. So normal people can also produce ketone bodies after fasting for a while, but they break power as soon as they eat breakfast. When there is a lot of glycogen, even if there is a lot of free fat ready to be broken down by the liver, ketone bodies are difficult to make. When liver sugar is low enough, ketone bodies are produced quickly. Usually after the third day of the ketogenic diet, the amount of ketone bodies will be determined by the amount of free fat.\n Note 3: Ratio of Insulin to Glucagon  With insulin = storage lipase is stimulated, fat cannot be broken down in fat cells. Without insulin plus high catecholamines = fat can be broken down. Breaking down fat is very troublesome and there are many very slow steps. When fat can be broken down, triglycerides in fat cells are broken down into glycerol + three free fatty acids. Free fat adheres to albumin and is transported in the blood to where it is needed to provide energy. If there is sufficient energy in other parts of the body, it will be sent to the liver to be broken down, and ketone bodies will be produced, which will be transported in the blood to the organs needed for energy.\n Note 4: The concentration of ketones in the blood of people who eat a mixed diet (starch, vegetables, meat) will be less than 0.5mmol / L, and the blood ketone concentration will be about 0.6 ~ 3mmo / L under a stable ketogenic diet.  How to eat a ketogenic diet? As mentioned before, as long as insulin secretion is low and the amount of sugar in the body is low enough, the body can produce more ketones.\nSo in fact, as long as we try to avoid foods that are too high in sugar and foods that raise too much insulin, we can keep the body stable in ketosis.\nIn terms of the main nutrient ratio, 5% sugars (high FII), 20-25% protein (medium FII), and 70-75% fat (low FII) will be 99% of people who can enter stable nutrition ketones. Disease ratio.\nBut I would recommend to gradually enter the ketogenic diet in a gradual way.\nSugar is less than 40 grams a day, protein eats about 1 to 1.4 grams of body weight a day, and fat is adjusted according to appetite. This is done because most people are unable to eat so much fat in the beginning, they will be a little psychologically afraid, and physically uncomfortable, so they should eat comfortably first.\nIf you count the main nutrients, you can choose your own food and eat the target data. It will be a relatively simple starting point, and then fine-tuning it will be fine.\nWhat to eat with ketogenic If it does not count nutrients, you can refer to the following suggestions:\nCan eat more  Various meats (cow, chicken, duck, goose, etc.), animal offal (heart, liver, kidneys), eggs, fish (don't be too lean), vegetables (you can eat more than root vegetables), high-fat fruits (olive, avocado, coconut) Meat), seaweed  Can eat in moderation Seafood (usually high-protein, low-fat ingredients), onions, spices\nYou can eat less (don’t eat it if you don’t go to weight loss) Blueberries, cranberries, legumes (tofu, tofu), nuts\ndo not eat Various starch or high sugar foods\nImage Youtube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/blog/foods/what_is_a_ketogenic_diet/","tags":["foods"],"title":"what is ketogenic diet"},{"categories":["Health"],"contents":"History of Panic Disorder In modern Health, it took nearly 150 years for panic disorder to be separated from the heart, nervous system, or other medical illness. The first person to record panic disorder was J. A. Hope , a British cardiologist . His cardiology textbook, written in 1832, contains a description of a patient with nervous palpitations.\n• There was nothing worse than that for the patient. He had a ridiculous imagination that he would die of an organic heart disease, and he was frightened by fear. The patient's thinking was very hard to shake off, because the depression and hopelessness of the neurotic condition that caused the patient's symptoms further fueled his imagination.\nIn 1871, US medical doctor Jacob Mendes DaCosta found that some of the soldiers who participated in the Civil War suddenly had chest pains, pain in the heart area, and difficulty breathing. DaCosta is a soldier to think outside the autonomic nervous system \u0026ldquo;sensitive heart (made actual heart disease, but the heart is sensitive by Boa severe activity and frequent exciting as things such as personal injury or severe physical illness during the battle caused the symptoms Irritable Heart )\u0026rdquo; Named it. This was much better known over the course of several wars since the \u0026quot; DaCosta syndrome\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the heart of the soldier ( Soldier's Heart )\u0026quot;, \u0026ldquo;efforts syndrome ( combination with Effort syndrome has called it).\u0026rdquo;\nIt wasn't until 1940 that these symptoms were accepted as an anxiety reaction and became known as a psychiatrist, not a physician, but a psychiatrist. Since then, panic disorder has been treated and treated like general anxiety symptoms and started to be treated separately from chronic anxiety by Donald Klein . Klein recently discovered that during clinical trials with imipramine, an antidepressant, he found that patients had fewer panic attacks and also found that panic symptoms occurred regardless of depression or other psychiatric symptoms. This led to a panic attack that was characterized by a sudden anxiety that was completely different from chronic anxiety.\nIn addition, a more scientific approach to the congestion of panic attacks has begun through tests of panic attack triggered by the injection of lactate by Pitts et al.\nWhat is panic disorder? Even if it's not a medical condition, when we are suddenly surprised or in extreme anxiety, we often say we're in panic. But the panic attacks we're going to talk about are the same, but they're a different concept.\nPanic is simply a sudden sense of fear that comes from a life-threatening situation. So panic is a reaction of our body that can appear normally in anyone who is actually life-threatening.\nPanic attacks, however, are a pathological condition that causes the body's alert system to malfunction and react as if they were threatened, although not particularly threatening.\nFor example, imagine you saw a robber with a knife while you were alone at night. Anyone reacts to their hair stuttering, their eyes wide open, their mouths wide open, their heart pounding sharply, their breathing jawless, their hands and feet trembling, and so on. You will taste fear.\nAnxiety in real dangerous situations has an important function that helps us protect ourselves. If we feel no anxiety under extreme circumstances, we will find it difficult to sustain life or be very injured. Therefore, the primary purpose of anxiety is to protect yourself from danger.\nHowever, if you do not try this experience at any time, not when you have to feel dangerous or insecure, it will be hard for you to continue your daily life.\nThis is a panic disorder!\nPanic and Panic Attacks\nCan I get panic disorder? Many people experience panic attacks in their lifetime. Some studies show that about 30% of the adult population has experienced more than one panic attack.\nHowever, these common panic attacks usually don't occur repeatedly at one time and are not diagnosed as panic disorder. Therefore, once you have experienced a panic attack, you do not have to think that you are a panic disorder.\nHowever, if panic attacks occur repeatedly and the seizures are not caused by any particular stress or physical cause, they can be diagnosed with panic disorder. The prevalence of panic disorder in our country is usually known to be 1 to 2%.\nMany people with panic disorder don't know they are panic disorders and are misunderstood that they have problems with their heart or other body. This is not just a phenomenon in Korea. Because symptoms of panic disorder are accompanied by so many physical symptoms, many people often take a long time to get proper treatment or help because they do not consider it a mental cause.\ncause  So why do these panic disorders happen?  Because of the treatment of panic disorder in psychiatry, many people think that panic disorder is caused by weak heart and fear. So I often think, \u0026lsquo;I'm not so weak, but I can't get panic disorder.\u0026rsquo; Because of the test, I often hear that there is no abnormality in my body and it seems to be neurotic symptoms.\nHowever, to date, panic disorder is known to be best explained by neurobiological causes. In addition, genetic and psychosocial factors are working together.\nFirst, a quick look at neurobiological causes are the substances that can cause panic attacks. The substances that can cause panic attacks are divided into neurochemical substances that act on the norepinephrine, serotonin, and GABA receptors of the central nervous system, hyperventilation, and respiratory substances that break the acid-base balance in vivo.\nIt is natural for a person to feel anxious in situations where he must be anxious, at which time an organ called the amygdala nucleus of the brain mediates various organs that cause anxiety. The cerebral cortex plays a role in misrecognizing and fearfully accepting a situation that will not be anxious, and the gray matter of the brain is responsible for causing a reaction to flee or freeze the fear. The hypothalamus stimulates the secretion of the sympathetic nervous system and hormones, such as sweating and heartburn, and the stimulus acts to stimulate the secretion of norepinephrine in the central nervous system. It will act as an adjustment.\nIn patients with panic disorder, their close relatives are said to have about 10 times more cases of panic disorder than the general population. In identical twins, when one has panic disorder, the other is also at a 45 percent chance of developing panic disorder. Recently, a lot of genetic research has been done, but no specific genes or chromosomal sites have been identified that are linked to panic disorder.\nPsychoanalysts say that panic attacks appear when an individual's unacceptable thoughts, wishes, and impulses are suppressed and unconscious, and at some point unconscious content is about to burst into consciousness. Also, losing parents or having anxiety when you were younger plays an important role, and many times you have a panic attack for the first time since you actually lost a close person or experienced severe mental stress.\nCognitive-behavioral theory suggests that anxiety is caused by learning or by conditional responses. For example, in the case of Mr. A, a panic attack first appeared during driving, so when you drive, you are reminded of your previous panic attack and you are easily anxious.\nIn addition, people with panic disorder are often more anxious because they are overly sensitive to minor changes in their senses. For example, if your heart beats faster or you have a slight feeling of tightness in your heart, you may be thinking that you may die of a heart attack.\nSymptom  Symptoms of Panic Attacks  A 33-year-old A was driving to work and suddenly, his chest jumped and seemed to be short of breath. A was scared of dying as soon as he was, leaving his car on his shoulder and calling 119 to go to the emergency room. But when I arrived at the emergency room and waited for a while, the symptoms subsided and I returned home after hearing that there was nothing wrong with the various tests. I was told there was nothing wrong, but these symptoms were repeated several times later, and each time the emergency room was told that there was nothing wrong with my body. When these things repeated, Mr. A was afraid that this would happen again and that fear prevented him from driving alone. A was advised to go to the psychiatrist in the emergency room, but he thought it was because he couldn't find his illness in the emergency room.\nIs A's story similar to yours? • You may feel short of breath or shortness of breath. • I feel dizzy, wobbly, or fainting. • Your pulse is getting faster or your heart is beating. • My hands and feet tremble. • I sweat. • You feel as if you are choking like someone is choking. • You may feel groaning or vomiting. • I feel like I'm in a different world, or I feel like I'm not myself. • Feeling limbs or numbness. • You feel burning or chilling. • You feel pain or discomfort in the chest area. • Feel the fear of dying. • You feel afraid to go crazy or lose control of yourself.\nIf four or more of the symptoms listed above occur suddenly and get worse and peak, within 10 minutes, you have a panic attack. Most panic attacks peak within 10 minutes of physical symptoms accompanied by anxiety, which lasts 20 to 30 minutes and then go away on their own. People with panic disorder do not always have panic attacks all day. The frequency of symptoms varies greatly from person to person, but only a few times a year, but in extreme cases, panic attacks may occur several times a day.\nWhen panic attacks occur again even when there are no panic attacks, there are many unpredictable anxieties. This is why many patients, like Mr. A, experience difficulties in their lives because of anxiety rather than panic attacks.\nDiagnosis of Panic Disorder • Panic disorder requires a repeated and unexpected panic attack. You may also continue to worry about panic attacks and other seizures or worry about the implications of panic attacks or their consequences (e.g. losing control over yourself or a heart attack). There must be a clear change. It should not be a direct symptom of addictive substances or drugs or general physical condition (such as hyperthyroidism) and should not be due to other mental illnesses such as social phobia, specific fear, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or anxiety disorder.\nAre you a panic disorder? In order to be diagnosed with panic disorder, the possibility of coronary artery disease such as myocardial infarction or angina pectoris, thyroid or parathyroid disease, epilepsy, pheochromocytoma, vestibular neuropathy, hypoglycemia and ventricular tachycardia should be discriminated. It is necessary to distinguish major depression, general anxiety disorder, social phobia, schizophrenia, somatoform disorder, borderline personality disorder, and adaptation disorder.\nTherefore, do not look at the symptoms and judge them quickly. Instead, see your psychiatrist for diagnosis.\nTreatment of Panic Disorder  Do I need panic disorder?  Is panic disorder an important disease? Panic disorder requires early diagnosis and early treatment.\nPanic disorder is a disease that can be cured most of the time if you get the right treatment at the right time. But if you don't get treatment, it's a disease that can progress.\nPanic disorder begins with no major difficulties in life except for the occasional panic attacks, which can lead to health problems due to repeated physical symptoms and tests. This situation is repeated, avoiding places or situations where panic attacks are likely to occur, and after that, we are afraid of all of our daily social activities, This can lead to a wide range of phobias, which can cause patients to feel hopeless, depressed, rely on alcohol, neuro stabilizers, or even commit suicide.\nIt is most important to start treatment as soon as possible so that you do not progress to this stage.\nMedication Medications for panic disorders are primarily recommended for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, a type of antidepressant. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are good therapeutic agents and safer, but anti-anxiety medications such as benzodiazepines are often used early in treatment because panic attacks usually take more than two to three weeks.\nMany psychiatric drugs are misleading because they are addictive and can damage the brain. In addition, it is not just a Health that calms down the symptoms today, but it also serves to cure and prevent recurrence. It is known that panic attacks may reappear in more than 50% of patients if they are stopped for a sufficient period of time, and studies show that the longer the duration of the drug use, the lower the recurrence rate.\nBenzodiazepines are used for the treatment of acute phase because they are very effective in reducing panic attacks. However, because it is a drug that can develop resistance, it is necessary to use it for a short time carefully according to the psychiatrist's prescription.\nThe most important aspect of medication is that it must be done according to the prescription and instructions of a psychiatrist. If the patient takes or discontinues the Health at random, the treatment may not be performed properly, but the anxiety may be worse.\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy is known to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder, and more effectively when combined with medication.\nCognitive behavioral therapy is a treatment that focuses on correcting behaviors that attempt to correct and avoid distorted thinking by revealing a close link between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Eventually, correcting distorted thoughts and actions reduces anxiety, fear, or panic attacks.\nCognitive behavioral treatment of panic disorder provides an intimate approach to patients and situations where panic disorders are subject to cognitive treatment and fear, which elaborates on patients with panic disorder and captures various prejudices that are misunderstood or misbelieved. Includes behavioral therapies to help you.\nTo do this, you must observe your symptoms or reactions objectively. For this purpose, you should prepare a panic record table, mood record table, etc. It is.\nIn addition to active treatment, some efforts are helpful in daily life. High levels of caffeine can aggravate panic disorders, so avoid using excessive amounts of caffeine-containing foods such as coffee, tea, and energy drinks. In addition, alcohol seems to relieve anxiety when you drink it, but it is better to stay away from alcohol because it can cause panic as you lose energy.\nYoutube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/blog/health/panic_disorder_treatment_of_panic_disorder/","tags":["Health"],"title":"What is Panic disorder How to Avoid And Diagnosis"},{"categories":["Health"],"contents":"Justice Pneumonia is an inflammation of the subbronchial area of ​​the lung (lung), especially in the alveoli (air pockets).\nPneumonia Pneumonia\ncause The most common cause is microbial infections, which are bacteria or viruses, and rarely can be fungal infections. In addition to infectious pneumonia caused by microorganisms, non-infectious pneumonia may be caused by aspiration of foreign substances such as chemicals or vomiting, aspiration of gases, or radiation therapy .\nSymptom Pneumonia causes inflammation of the lungs, impairing the normal functioning of the lungs, resulting in pulmonary symptoms and systemic symptoms throughout the body. Pulmonary symptoms include coughing caused by respiratory irritation, sputum caused by the release of inflammatory substances, and dyspnea caused by impaired breathing. Phlegm can come in sticky, pus-like appearance, and blood can come out. Inflammation of the pleura that surrounds the lungs can cause pain when breathing, and other than the respiratory system, digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can occur. In addition, systemic diseases throughout the body, such as headaches, fatigue, muscle pain , and joint pain , can occur. Systemic reactions of inflammation usually cause fever or chills.\nDiagnosis / Test First of all, it can be suspected through medical history listening and examination, and chest x-ray can be used to check for changes in lung shade. However , if no visible shadows are found on the x-ray , tests such as chest computed tomography ( CT ) may be done. Identifying the causative microorganisms is not easy, but it is possible to diagnose the causative organism through sputum culture, causative bacteria, blood culture test, or urine antigen test.\ncure Pneumonia caused by microorganisms is treated according to the causative organism, and antibiotics are treated. In general, pneumonia in the community is assumed to be bacterial pneumonia, empirically treated with antibiotics, and when the causative microorganism is identified, it is changed to an appropriate antibiotic. Viral pneumonia, such as influenza, has antiviral effects early in the onset of symptoms, but the effect of antiviral agents is less pronounced after a period of time.\nIf the condition is mild and hospitalization is not necessary, it is not necessary to be hospitalized and treated. However, inpatient treatment is recommended for children with low immunity, elderly patients and patients with severe diseases. Unless there is no complication or resistance to pneumonia caused by resistant drugs, treatment is usually enough for 10-14 days. If you are severely unable to breathe on your own, you should seek mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.\nProgress / Complications It has a very diverse course and varies according to the basic condition of the patient and the causative agent of pneumonia. Pneumonia may progress to sepsis or shock, and partial complications of the lung may be accompanied by empyema, pulmonary abscess, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe cases can lead to death.\nPrevention method There are vaccines to prevent pneumonia caused by flu or pneumococci. Pneumococcal vaccines do not provide complete protection against pneumonia, but are effective in reducing severe pneumococcal infections.\nTest Youtube video   ","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/blog/health/pneumonia/","tags":["health"],"title":"What is Pneumonia How to get rid of it"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://mentalillness.consulting/blog/health/signs_and_symptoms_early_signs_of_dementi/","tags":null,"title":""}]
